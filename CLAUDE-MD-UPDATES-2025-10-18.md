## HOW THIS WORKS IN FUTURE SESSIONS

### Automatic Application

When you start a new conversation with Claude Code:

1. **Claude reads CLAUDE.md automatically** (it's in the system prompt)
2. **All rules are loaded into memory** for that session
3. **Claude will enforce these rules** without you asking

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Someone tries to add a new payment method**
```
Claude will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Check if NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix is used for frontend variables
- ‚úÖ Verify DRY principle (no duplicate initialization code)
- ‚úÖ Reference Square Payment Configuration section
```

**Scenario 2: Someone tries to modify Southwest Cargo**
```
Claude will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Verify using /modules/southwest-cargo (not /providers/)
- ‚úÖ Check that database is being used (not hardcoded arrays)
- ‚úÖ Reference Southwest Cargo Shipping section
```

**Scenario 3: Someone duplicates code**
```
Claude will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect code duplication
- ‚úÖ Suggest extracting to shared utility
- ‚úÖ Reference DRY principles section
```
