## 🐛 If Something Still Doesn't Work

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Try the operation (create/delete/edit)**
4. **Check the failed request:**
   - Status Code: Should be 200 (not 401)
   - Request Headers: Should include `Cookie: auth_session=...`
   - Response: Should show actual data (not "Unauthorized")

### If Still Getting "Unauthorized":

- **Problem:** Browser cache may have old JavaScript
- **Solution:** Hard refresh the page:
  - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
  - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
- **Or:** Clear browser cache and reload

### If Products Still Not Creating:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify you're logged in as admin
3. Check network tab to see if request is being sent
4. Look at response for specific error message

## 📝 What Changed

### Root Cause of All Issues:

**The container was running OLD CODE from 20:35 (1.5 hours ago)**

I made all the fixes (added `credentials: 'include'`) but never rebuilt the Docker image. The container kept running the old code where fetch requests didn't send authentication cookies.

### Timeline:

- 01:50 UTC: Identified missing credentials
- 01:52 UTC: Added credentials to all fetch calls
- 01:53 UTC: Started build (never completed properly)
- 02:06 UTC: Fixed image upload bug
- 02:08 UTC: Started FINAL build with all fixes
- 02:13 UTC: Deployed and restarted container ✅

## ✅ READY TO TEST NOW

**Go ahead and try creating a new product!**

The 3-4 products you tried to create earlier failed because of the old code. Now with the fixes deployed, product creation should work.

**Expected Result:** Product count should increase from 12 → 13 → 14, etc.

**Container Status:** Running and healthy ✅
**Build Status:** Latest code deployed ✅
**API Status:** All endpoints operational ✅
**Ready For Testing:** YES ✅
