## ✨ IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED (October 25, 2025)

### 1. Logo.svg Placeholder Created
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **File:** `/public/logo.svg`
- **Description:** Professional "GR" monogram in brand colors (orange #F97316)
- **Impact:** Resolves 404 error, ready for final logo replacement

### 2. Trailing Slash Configuration
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **File:** `next.config.mjs`
- **Setting:** `trailingSlash: false`
- **Impact:** Explicitly documented URL structure for SEO consistency

### 3. Locale Prefix Strategy Review
- **Status:** ✅ Complete (kept 'always')
- **Decision:** Maintain `localePrefix: 'always'` in routing.ts
- **Reason:** App architecture uses `[locale]` in all route paths
- **Impact:** Stable routing, all URLs require explicit locale (/en/, /es/)
- **Note:** Architecture incompatible with 'as-needed' strategy

### 4. Comprehensive Route Testing
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Result:** 15/15 tests passing (100%)
- **Coverage:** All routes (English/Spanish), API endpoints, static assets
- **Tool:** comprehensive-audit.js automated testing

## 💡 TECHNICAL NOTES

   - **Port:** 3020 (external) → 3002 (internal)
   - **Status:** Stable and healthy
   - **Uptime:** Consistent
   - **Resource Usage:** Optimal

3. **Database Strategy**
   - **Engine:** PostgreSQL (dedicated container)
   - **Port:** 5435
   - **Performance:** Excellent query times
   - **Backup:** Automated daily backups configured
