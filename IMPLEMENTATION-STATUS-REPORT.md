2. Browses products
3. Selects product
4. Configures options (qty, size, paper, etc.)
5. Sees pricing update in real-time
6. Adds to cart
7. Proceeds to checkout
8. Enters shipping address
9. Selects shipping method (FedEx rates)
10. Pays with Square or Cash
11. Receives confirmation email
12. Order appears in admin panel
13. Admin can process order
14. Customer can track order in account
15. Customer can reorder
```

**Missing for Full MVP:**

- Full vendor automation (can do manually)
- PayPal/CashApp (have Square + Cash)

## Risk Assessment

   - Mitigation: Document manual process
   - Timeline: Complete in 2 weeks

### MEDIUM PRIORITY RISKS

1. **Missing Payment Options** (PayPal/CashApp)

   - Mitigation: Square covers most use cases
   - Timeline: Add in next sprint

2. **Theme Editor UI Missing**
   - Impact: Can't easily rebrand
   - Mitigation: Manual database updates
   - Timeline: Add in next sprint

### LOW PRIORITY RISKS
