## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Check Workflow Executions
```sql
SELECT
  we.id,
  we.status,
  we.currentStep,
  we.createdAt,
  mw.name as workflow_name
FROM "WorkflowExecution" we
JOIN "MarketingWorkflow" mw ON we."workflowId" = mw.id
ORDER BY we."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Email Sends
```sql
SELECT
  cs."recipientEmail",
  cs.status,
  cs."sentAt",
  c.name as campaign_name
FROM "CampaignSend" cs
JOIN "Campaign" c ON cs."campaignId" = c.id
ORDER BY cs."sentAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Cron Logs
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
tail -f /var/log/workflow-crons.log

# Last 50 lines
tail -n 50 /var/log/workflow-crons.log

# Search for errors
grep -i error /var/log/workflow-crons.log
```

## 🎯 What Happens Next

### When a User Registers:
1. User creates account
2. Welcome Series workflow triggers immediately
3. Welcome email sent via Resend
4. Wait 3 days
5. Onboarding tips email sent

### When a User Places an Order:
1. Order created in checkout
2. FunnelKit workflow triggered (if logged in)
3. Order data passed to workflow engine
4. Future: Post-purchase workflows can trigger

### Every Hour (Abandoned Carts):
1. Cron job scans CartSession table
2. Finds carts abandoned > 1 hour
3. Checks user hasn't ordered since
4. Triggers abandoned cart workflow for eligible users
5. Email sent after 1 hour wait

### Every Day (Inactive Customers):
1. Cron job scans all users with orders
2. Finds users with last order 90+ days ago
3. Triggers win-back workflow
4. "We miss you" email sent with special offer

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Email Opt-In Respected
- Marketing emails (abandoned cart, win-back) only sent if `user.marketingOptIn = true`
- Transactional emails (order confirmations) always sent
- SMS workflows check `user.smsOptIn` and `user.phoneNumber`

### Architecture
- **n8n**: Vendor notifications + daily admin reports (minimal, backend only)
- **FunnelKit**: All customer emails + analytics (primary, customer-facing)

### Error Handling
- Workflow failures logged to `WorkflowExecution.errorMessage`
- Doesn't crash order creation if workflow fails
- Check logs regularly for issues
