**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Production Ready - Both Carriers Working

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Critical Fix: FedEx Provider

**Solution:** Updated to `FedExProviderEnhanced` with 30+ services

**File Modified:** `/src/lib/shipping/shipping-calculator.ts`
```typescript
// Line 2: Changed import
import { FedExProviderEnhanced } from './providers/fedex-enhanced'

// Line 25: Use enhanced provider
this.providers.set(Carrier.FEDEX, new FedExProviderEnhanced())
```

### ✅ Verified: Southwest Cargo Integration
**Status:** Working correctly - 82 airports in database
**Airport Data:** All 82 Southwest Cargo locations stored in database
**API Endpoint:** `/api/airports` working properly
**Component:** Airport selector integrated in checkout flow

### ✅ Enhanced: Admin Shipping Settings Page
**Location:** Admin → Settings → Shipping tab
**Features Added:**
- Southwest Cargo section with 82 locations info

## How It Works

### Customer Checkout Flow

**1. Enter Shipping Address**
```
Customer enters: Dallas, TX 75201
```

**2. System Fetches Rates**
```
/api/shipping/calculate → POST
├─ FedEx Provider (Enhanced)
│  ├─ Authenticates with FedEx API
│  ├─ Optimizes packaging
│  ├─ Fetches real-time rates
│  └─ Returns 4-6 services
│
└─ Southwest Cargo Provider
   ├─ Checks state availability (TX ✓)
   ├─ Calculates weight-based pricing
   └─ Returns 2 services (Pickup + Dash)
```

**3. Customer Sees Rates**
```
✅ FedEx Ground - $15.50 (3-5 days)
✅ FedEx 2Day - $28.75 (2 days)
✅ FedEx Standard Overnight - $47.99 (1 day)
✅ FedEx Ground Economy - $12.25 (5-7 days)
✅ Southwest Cargo Pickup - $95.00 (3 days)
✅ Southwest Cargo Dash - $105.00 (1 day)
```

**4. If Southwest Selected**
```
→ Airport selector dropdown appears
→ Shows 82 airports filtered by state
→ Customer selects nearest airport
→ Pickup details in order confirmation
```

### State-Based Availability

**Example: Texas (TX)**
- FedEx: ✅ All services available
- Southwest: ✅ Multiple airports (DAL, HOU, AUS, SAT, etc.)

**Example: New York (NY)**
