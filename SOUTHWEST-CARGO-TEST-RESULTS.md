## üí° Why Chicago Doesn't Show Southwest

**This is correct behavior:**
- Chicago (IL) = Your warehouse/origin
- Southwest Cargo = Airport pickup at DESTINATION
- Shipping from Chicago ‚Üí Chicago for airport pickup makes no sense
- System correctly excludes Southwest for IL addresses

**To see Southwest Cargo, use any supported state EXCEPT Illinois.**
