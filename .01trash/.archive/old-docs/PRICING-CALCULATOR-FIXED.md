# Pricing Calculator - FIXED ✅ (2025-10-12)

## 🎯 Summary

The pricing calculator is now **fully functional** with realistic pricing and proper shipping weight calculations. All fixes have been tested and verified.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Test Product Base Price ($0 → $0.05)
**Problem:** Test product had `basePrice = 0` causing all prices to calculate as $0.00
**Solution:** Updated product basePrice to $0.05 per square inch (realistic pricing)
**Result:** Prices now calculate correctly based on quantity, size, and options

### 2. Size Dimensions Parser (null → actual values)
**Problem:** Size strings like "11×17" weren't parsing because transformer only looked for "x" not "×"
**File:** `/src/lib/utils/size-transformer.ts`
**Solution:** Updated regex to support multiple separator characters: `x, X, ×, ×, ✕`
**Result:** All 15 sizes now parse correctly with proper width, height, and square inches

### 3. Verified Paper Stock Weights
**Status:** ✅ All paper stocks have correct weight values for shipping calculations
**Range:** 0.0002 - 0.0005 lbs per square inch
**Result:** Shipping weight calculations work correctly (tested 540 lbs for 5000 × 12×18)

const match = sizeStr.match(/^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*[xX××✕]\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)$/)
