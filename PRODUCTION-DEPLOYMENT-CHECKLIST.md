## üîß PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Database & Environment
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Verify all production env vars are set
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` points to production PostgreSQL
  - [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set with strong secret
  - [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` configured for email
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables properly set
- [ ] **Database Migration**: Run production migrations
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy
  npx prisma generate
  ```
- [ ] **Database Seeding**: Verify essential data is populated

### Security & Performance
- [ ] **Lucia Auth Configuration**: Verify session management
- [ ] **CORS Settings**: Ensure proper domain restrictions
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Confirm API rate limits are active
- [ ] **SSL/TLS**: Verify HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Confirm Next.js security headers

### Docker Deployment (MANDATORY per CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] **Docker Compose Setup**: Use docker-compose.yml for deployment
- [ ] **Port Configuration**: Deploy on port 3002 (per CLAUDE.md requirements)
- [ ] **PostgreSQL Service**: Create isolated database instance
- [ ] **MinIO Configuration**: Set up new bucket for GangRun Printing
- [ ] **Redis Setup**: Configure caching/session storage
- [ ] **Network Isolation**: Ensure complete isolation from SteppersLife.com

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] **Application Logging**: Verify logs are captured
- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Confirm error monitoring is active
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Set up APM if needed
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Implement /health endpoint monitoring

## üö¶ DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Build verification
npm run build

# TypeScript check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Database connection test
npx prisma db push --preview-feature
```

### 2. Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d --build

# Verify services
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs gangrun-printing
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] **Application Loads**: Homepage accessible on port 3002
- [ ] **Authentication Works**: Sign-in/magic links functional
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Core APIs returning expected responses
- [ ] **Database Connectivity**: Orders/products loading correctly
- [ ] **File Uploads**: MinIO integration working
- [ ] **Email Service**: Resend integration functional

### 4. Rollback Plan
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Current production state backed up
- [ ] **Quick Rollback**: Previous Docker images available
- [ ] **Database Backup**: Pre-migration database snapshot taken

## üîç KNOWN ISSUES TO MONITOR

### Non-Critical TypeScript Warnings
- ESLint configuration warnings (build still succeeds)
- Dynamic export warnings in Next.js (warnings only, no errors)
- Some relation naming inconsistencies (functional but could be improved)

### Performance Considerations
- Large number of Prisma queries may need optimization
- Consider implementing query caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor build times and bundle sizes

## ‚úÖ FINAL VERIFICATION STATUS

**ALL AUDIT REQUIREMENTS VERIFIED:**
1. ‚úÖ Production build succeeds
2. ‚úÖ TypeScript errors resolved
3. ‚úÖ No console runtime errors
4. ‚úÖ Authentication functionality works
5. ‚úÖ Core API endpoints operational

**DEPLOYMENT READY**: Application is ready for production deployment following Docker Compose methodology as specified in CLAUDE.md.
