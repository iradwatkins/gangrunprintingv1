## Usage Examples

### Running Tests
```bash
# Development testing
npm test                    # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage analysis
npm run test:e2e:ui        # Interactive E2E testing

# CI/Production testing
npm run test:run           # Single run
npm run test:e2e          # Headless E2E testing
```

### Database Testing
```bash
# Setup test environment
npm run test:db:setup      # Create schema
npm run test:db:seed       # Add test data
