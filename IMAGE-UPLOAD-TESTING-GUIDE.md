# Product Image Upload - Testing Guide ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** All fixes deployed, ready for manual testing

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Images Not Saving (CRUD Operations)
**Problem:** Images uploaded but didn't save to database when creating/editing products

**Root Cause:** Missing required database fields (`id` and `updatedAt`) in Image.create()

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `/src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`
- Added `id: randomUUID()` and `updatedAt: new Date()` to Image.create()
- ✅ Database constraints now satisfied

### Issue #2: Images Disappearing with 404 Errors
**Problem:** Images uploaded, appeared briefly, then disappeared with 404 errors

**Root Cause:** Wrong public URL format - missing `/minio/` path prefix

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `docker-compose.yml` line 127
- Changed: `MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://gangrunprinting.com/minio`
- Container recreated with: `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate app`
- ✅ URLs now correctly formatted

### Issue #3: Multi-Image Upload Race Conditions
**Problem:** Uploading multiple images caused wrong images to update or disappear

**Root Cause:** React state updates using stale props in async operations

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `/src/components/admin/product-image-upload.tsx`
- Added `uploadId` tracking for each file
- Changed to callback form: `onImagesChange((prevImages) => ...)`
- ✅ No more race conditions

## ✅ Verification Status

### Environment Configuration
```bash
✅ MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://gangrunprinting.com/minio (CORRECT)
✅ Container recreated and running
✅ Health check: 100/100
✅ MinIO container running on ports 9002/9102
```

### URLs Now Generated As:
```
✅ CORRECT: https://gangrunprinting.com/minio/gangrun-products/products/optimized/123.jpg
❌ WRONG (before): https://gangrunprinting.com/gangrun-products/products/optimized/123.jpg
```

### Test 2: Create Product with Multiple Images

1. Go to: https://gangrunprinting.com/admin/products/new
2. Fill in basic info
3. **Upload 3 images at once:**

   - Set a different image as primary
6. Click "Create Product"
7. **Verify:**
   - Product saves successfully
   - All 3 images saved
   - Order is preserved
   - Primary image is correct

**Expected Result:** All 3 images upload and save correctly ✅

---

### Test 3: Edit Existing Product - Add Images

1. Go to: https://gangrunprinting.com/admin/products
2. Click "Edit" on any existing product
3. Scroll to images section
4. **Add 2 new images:**

---

### Test 4: Edit Product - Replace Images

1. Edit an existing product with images
2. **Delete 1 existing image:**
   - Click the trash/delete icon
   - Confirm deletion
3. **Upload 1 new image:**
   - Upload a replacement
4. Click "Save Product"
5. **Verify:**
   - Deleted image is gone

   - Other images unaffected

**Expected Result:** Selective deletion and replacement works ✅

---

### Test 5: Browser DevTools Verification ⭐ IMPORTANT

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Upload a product image
4. **Check for errors:**
   - ❌ Should see NO errors
   - ❌ Should see NO 404 responses
   - ✅ Should see successful upload messages
5. Go to **Network** tab
6. Upload another image
7. **Check network requests:**
   - Look for: `POST /api/products/upload-image`
   - Status should be: `200 OK`
   - Response should have: `{success: true, data: {url: "https://..."}}`
8. **Check image URL:**
   - Find the image request in Network tab
   - URL should be: `https://gangrunprinting.com/minio/gangrun-products/...`
   - Status should be: `200 OK`
   - Type should be: `image/jpeg` or `image/png`

**Expected Result:** No errors, all requests succeed with correct URLs ✅

---

### Test 6: Image Persistence After Page Refresh

1. Create a product with images
2. **Note the product ID** from URL
3. Close the browser tab completely
4. Open a new browser tab
5. Go directly to: `https://gangrunprinting.com/admin/products/[ID]/edit`
6. **Verify:**
   - All images load immediately
   - No 404 errors
   - Images display correctly
7. Refresh the page (F5)
8. **Verify again:**
   - Images still load
   - No errors

**Expected Result:** Images persist across sessions and page refreshes ✅

## 🐛 If Issues Occur

### Images Still Disappearing:
```bash
# Check environment variable in container
docker exec gangrunprinting_app env | grep MINIO_PUBLIC

# Should output:
# MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://gangrunprinting.com/minio

# If wrong, check docker-compose.yml line 127
# Then recreate container:
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate app
```

### 404 Errors on Image URLs:
```bash
# Check MinIO container is running
docker ps | grep minio

# Should see:
# gangrunprinting-minio   Up X minutes   0.0.0.0:9002->9000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9102->9001/tcp

# Test MinIO is accessible:
curl -I https://gangrunprinting.com/minio/

# Should return MinIO headers (even if 403, proves proxy works)
```

### Images Not Saving to Database:
Check browser console for detailed error messages. Common issues:
- Missing required product fields (not related to images)
- Network timeouts (file too large)
- Server errors (check docker logs)

```bash
# Check application logs
docker logs --tail=50 gangrunprinting_app | grep -i error
```
