# FIX YOUR EXACT ERRORS - Step by Step

Based on your error log, here are the 3 critical fixes needed:

---

## üî¥ ERROR #1: Wrong API Endpoint (500 Error)

**Your Error:**
```
api/checkout/process-square-payment:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500
```

**Problem:** Your API route is crashing

**Fix:**

### Step 1: Replace Your API Route

**File:** `app/api/checkout/process-square-payment/route.ts`

Copy the code from artifact: **"YOUR API Route - app/api/checkout/process-square-payment/route.ts"**

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variable

Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```bash
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

**CRITICAL:** No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for the access token (server-side only)

---

## üî¥ ERROR #2: Cash App Container Not Found

**Your Error:**
```
[Cash App Pay] Initialization error: Error: Cash App Pay container not found after 3 seconds
```

**Problem:** Your current code is trying to initialize Cash App but the container doesn't exist

**Fix:** Use the simpler component that only does credit cards for now

**File:** `src/components/checkout/square-card-payment.tsx`

Copy the code from artifact: **"Square Component - Fixed for YOUR API Endpoint"**

This version:
- ‚úÖ Uses YOUR API endpoint: `/api/checkout/process-square-payment`
- ‚úÖ Only initializes credit card (no Cash App for now)
- ‚úÖ Uses correct container ID: `card-container`
- ‚úÖ Uses NEW Square tokenization approach

---

## üî¥ ERROR #3: Initialization Timeout

**Your Error:**
```
[Square] Initialization timeout after 10 seconds
```

**Problem:** Square is taking too long to load or environment variables are wrong

**Fix:**

### Verify Environment Variables

Run this in your browser console:
```javascript
console.log({
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID,
  locationId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID,
});
```

Both should show values starting with `sq0idp-` and `L` respectively.

If they're `undefined`:

1. Check your `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=sq0idp-YOUR_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=LWMA9R9E2ENXP
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

2. Restart your server:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

---

## ‚ö° QUICK FIX - DO THIS NOW

### 1. Clean Everything
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next
```

### 2. Replace These 2 Files

**File 1:** `src/components/checkout/square-card-payment.tsx`
- Copy from artifact: "Square Component - Fixed for YOUR API Endpoint"

**File 2:** `app/api/checkout/process-square-payment/route.ts`
- Copy from artifact: "YOUR API Route"

### 3. Verify `.env.local`

Make sure it has exactly this format:
```bash
# CLIENT-SIDE (with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=sq0idp-AJF8fI5VayKCqvlJL_example
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=LWMA9R9E2ENXP

# SERVER-SIDE (NO NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAAAl1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j_example

# ENVIRONMENT
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 4. Restart
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test in Incognito
- Open: `http://localhost:3000/checkout`
- Open Console (F12)

## üêõ IF STILL BROKEN

### Check Backend Logs

The new API route has detailed logging. Look for:
```
‚ùå Missing sourceId
‚ùå Missing amount
‚ùå Missing locationId
‚ùå Missing SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN env variable
```

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Still getting 500 error**
- Check: Is `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env.local`?
- Check: Did you restart the server after adding it?
- Check: Is the token valid? (not expired)

**Issue 2: "Missing Square credentials"**
- Variables need `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side
- Restart server after changing `.env.local`

**Issue 3: Card container not found**
- Make sure your component has: `<div id="card-container" />`
- Check: Is the component properly mounted?

---

## üìã CHECKLIST

Before testing:

- [ ] Replaced `square-card-payment.tsx` with fixed version
- [ ] Replaced `app/api/checkout/process-square-payment/route.ts`
- [ ] `.env.local` has correct format (NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client vars)
- [ ] Deleted `.next` folder
- [ ] Restarted dev server
- [ ] Testing in incognito mode
- [ ] Console is open to see logs

---

## üéØ KEY DIFFERENCES IN YOUR FIXED CODE

### 1. API Endpoint Changed
**OLD:** `/api/payment/process`
**NEW:** `/api/checkout/process-square-payment` ‚Üê YOUR actual endpoint

### 2. Container ID Changed
**OLD:** `square-card-container`
**NEW:** `card-container` ‚Üê Standard ID

### 3. No Cash App (For Now)
The fixed version only does credit cards. We'll add Cash App after cards work.

### 4. Better Error Logging
The API route now logs everything so you can see exactly what's failing.

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

**After credit cards work:**
1. We can add Cash App Pay
2. We can add Apple Pay / Google Pay
3. We can add error handling improvements

**But first, let's get credit cards working!**

Your main issues were:
1. ‚úÖ Wrong API endpoint path
2. ‚úÖ Backend was missing error handling
3. ‚úÖ Container IDs didn't match

These are all fixed in the new artifacts. Copy them exactly and restart! üéØ
