# Square 3D Secure Verification Fix

## ❌ The Error You Had

```
verificationDetails.intent is required and must be a(n) string.
verificationDetails.customerInitiated is required and must be a(n) boolean.
verificationDetails.sellerKeyedIn is required and must be a(n) boolean.
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The `verifyBuyer()` function requires **ALL** of these fields:

### **Required Fields:**

```typescript
const verificationDetails = {
  // 1. Intent - What you're doing with this payment
  intent: 'CHARGE', // ✅ Required: string - Use 'CHARGE' for immediate payment
  
  // 2. Amount - How much you're charging
  amount: amount.toString(), // ✅ Required: string (amount in cents)
  
  // 3. Currency
  currencyCode: 'USD', // ✅ Required: string
  
  // 4. Billing contact (optional but recommended)
  billingContact: {
    givenName: 'John',
    familyName: 'Doe',
  },
  
  // 5. Customer Initiated - NEW! This was missing
  customerInitiated: true, // ✅ Required: boolean
  // true = Customer is entering card themselves (online checkout)
  // false = Merchant is entering on behalf of customer (rare)
  
  // 6. Seller Keyed In - NEW! This was missing  
  sellerKeyedIn: false, // ✅ Required: boolean
  // false = Card entered online via payment form (standard)
  // true = Merchant manually keyed in card number (POS/phone orders)
};
```

## 📋 What Each Field Means

### **customerInitiated: true/false**

**For online checkout (your case):**
```typescript
customerInitiated: true
```
✅ Use `true` when:
- Customer is on your website
- Customer enters their own card
- Standard e-commerce checkout

❌ Use `false` when:
- Merchant initiates on customer's behalf
- Subscription renewals
- Saved card charges

### **sellerKeyedIn: true/false**

**For online form (your case):**
```typescript
sellerKeyedIn: false
```
✅ Use `false` when:
- Card entered via online payment form (your scenario)
- Square SDK handles the input
- Standard web checkout

❌ Use `true` when:
- Merchant manually types card into POS
- Phone orders where merchant keys in card
- Mail orders entered by merchant

## 🎯 For Your Website (GangRun Printing)

Since you're running an **online print shop** where customers checkout themselves:

```typescript
const verificationDetails = {
  intent: 'CHARGE',                    // Charging immediately
  amount: amount.toString(),           // Order total
  currencyCode: 'USD',                 // US Dollars
  billingContact: { /* ... */ },       // Customer info
  customerInitiated: true,             // ✅ Customer enters card
  sellerKeyedIn: false,                // ✅ Online form, not keyed
};
```

---

## 🔄 What Changed in the Component

### **Before (Missing Fields):**
```typescript
const verificationDetails = {
  intent: 'CHARGE',
  amount: amount.toString(),
  currencyCode: 'USD',
  // ❌ Missing customerInitiated
  // ❌ Missing sellerKeyedIn
};
```

### **After (All Required Fields):**
```typescript
const verificationDetails = {
  intent: 'CHARGE',
  amount: amount.toString(),
  currencyCode: 'USD',
  billingContact: { /* ... */ },
  customerInitiated: true,   // ✅ Added
  sellerKeyedIn: false,      // ✅ Added
};
```

## ✅ No Action Needed!

I've already updated the **Fixed Square Payment Component** artifact with these changes. 

**The component now has:**
- ✅ All required verification fields
- ✅ Proper 3D Secure handling
- ✅ Better error logging

---

## 🧪 What to Expect Now

### **In Console:**
```
🔵 Tokenizing payment...
✅ Token received: [token]
🔵 Verifying buyer with 3D Secure...
✅ Buyer verification complete: [verification-token]
🔵 Processing payment...
✅ Payment successful
```

### **Possible Variations:**
```
⚠️ Verification error (may not be required for this card)
```
This is **OK** - some cards don't require 3D Secure, payment will still process.

---

## 🎯 Testing

### **Test Card (Standard Visa):**
```
Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
CVV: 111
Expiry: 12/25
ZIP: 12345
```

**Expected:** No verification errors, payment succeeds

### **Test Card (3D Secure Required):**
```
Card: 4000 0027 6000 3184
CVV: 111  
Expiry: 12/25
ZIP: 12345
```

**Expected:** 3D Secure challenge appears, then payment succeeds

---

## 📊 Complete Flow Now

```
1. User enters card details
2. User clicks "Pay"
3. Square tokenizes card
4. verifyBuyer() called with ALL required fields ✅
5. 3D Secure verification completes ✅
6. Backend processes payment
7. Success!
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes (Avoided Now)

### ❌ **Wrong:** Omitting fields
```typescript
const verificationDetails = {
  intent: 'CHARGE',
  amount: amount.toString(),
  // Missing required fields!
};
```

### ❌ **Wrong:** Wrong data types
```typescript
const verificationDetails = {
  intent: 'CHARGE',
  customerInitiated: 'true', // ❌ String instead of boolean
  sellerKeyedIn: 'false',    // ❌ String instead of boolean
};
```

### ✅ **Correct:** All fields with correct types
```typescript
const verificationDetails = {
  intent: 'CHARGE',           // ✅ String
  amount: '5000',             // ✅ String (not number)
  currencyCode: 'USD',        // ✅ String
  customerInitiated: true,    // ✅ Boolean
  sellerKeyedIn: false,       // ✅ Boolean
};
```

## 💡 Why These Fields Matter

Square uses these fields to:

1. **Assess fraud risk** - Different risk for customer vs merchant initiated
2. **Apply correct fees** - Keyed-in cards have higher processing fees
3. **Meet regulations** - PSD2/SCA compliance in Europe
4. **Route 3D Secure** - Determines if/how to challenge customer

Even though you're in the US, Square requires these fields for all merchants globally.

---

## ✅ Summary

**What was wrong:**
- Missing `customerInitiated` field
- Missing `sellerKeyedIn` field

**What was fixed:**
- Added `customerInitiated: true` (customer enters card)
- Added `sellerKeyedIn: false` (online form, not keyed)

**What you need to do:**
- Nothing! The component is already updated
- Just use the latest version from artifacts

---

**The updated component now has all required verification fields. No more verification errors!** 🎉
