    question: 'What is gang run printing and how does it save money?',
    answer:
      "Gang run printing combines multiple customers' print jobs on one large press sheet to maximize efficiency. Instead of running your 500 business cards alone, we group them with other orders on the same paper stock and coating. This reduces setup time, paper waste, and costs - savings we pass directly to you. You get professional offset print quality at digital print prices.",

    question: 'What is the difference between digital and offset printing?',

      'Digital printing is ideal for short runs (under 500 pieces) with quick turnaround and no setup fees. Offset printing is used for larger quantities (500+) and provides superior color accuracy, consistency across large runs, and lower per-piece cost. We automatically select the best printing method based on your quantity and specifications.',
