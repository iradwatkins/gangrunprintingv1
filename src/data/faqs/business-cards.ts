    question: 'What is the difference between gloss and matte finish?',
    answer:
      'Gloss finish provides a shiny, vibrant appearance that makes colors pop and is fingerprint-resistant. Matte finish offers a sophisticated, non-reflective surface that is easy to write on and provides excellent readability. Silk (satin) finish combines the best of both with a subtle sheen.',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I print on both sides of the business card?',
    answer:

  {
    question: 'What color mode should I use - RGB or CMYK?',
    answer:
      'Always use CMYK color mode for print files. RGB colors (used for screens) will be automatically converted to CMYK and may shift slightly. For color accuracy, design in CMYK from the start. We recommend ordering a printed proof if color matching is critical.',

  {
    question: 'Can I see a proof before printing my business cards?',
    answer:
      'Yes! We provide a free digital PDF proof via email for your approval before production begins. Physical printed proofs are available for an additional fee and add 2-3 days to turnaround time. Digital proofs show layout and text but colors may vary slightly on different screens.',

  },
  {
    question: 'How should I prepare my business card design for bleed?',
    answer:
      'Add 0.125" (1/8 inch) bleed on all four sides of your design. This means your final PDF should be 3.75" x 2.25" with the safe area for text and logos at least 0.125" from the trim edge. Our free templates include bleed and safe zone guides.',
    category: 'Design Guidelines',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is spot UV coating and is it worth it?',
    answer:
      'Spot UV is a glossy, raised coating applied to specific areas of your card (like logos or text) while the rest has a matte finish. This creates a striking contrast and premium feel. It adds $0.15-0.25 per card but significantly increases perceived value and memorability.',
