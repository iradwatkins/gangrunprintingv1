# Product Copy "View Product" Fix - October 16, 2025

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Inactive products can no longer be viewed publicly
**Issue:** "Product Not Found" error when clicking "View Product" on copied products

---

## üéØ Issue Summary

When copying a product, the copied product is set to `isActive: false` by design (for review before publishing). However, clicking the "View Product" button (eye icon) in the admin panel tried to show the product on the customer-facing page, resulting in "Product Not Found" error.

**User Report:** "WHEN I COPY THE PRODUCT i get these errors"
- URL attempted: `https://gangrunprinting.com/products/test-product-1760623817062-copy-qkf8z4-copy-ix1nw2`
- Error: "Product Not Found"
- Console warning about Square.js preload

## üîç Root Cause

### Expected Behavior (Working Correctly)
1. ‚úÖ Product duplicate API creates copy with `isActive: false`
2. ‚úÖ Copied product appears in admin product list
3. ‚úÖ Copied product has all configuration (images, paper stocks, etc.)

### The Problem
4. ‚ùå "View Product" button (eye icon) was always enabled
5. ‚ùå Clicking it on inactive product navigates to `/products/{slug}`
6. ‚ùå Customer-facing product page only shows active products
7. ‚ùå Result: "Product Not Found" error

**Why this happens:** The product duplicate route intentionally sets `isActive: false` (line 89 in `/src/app/api/products/[id]/duplicate/route.ts`) so admins can review the copy before making it public.

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### File: `/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`

**Lines: 365-404**

**Before:**
```tsx
<Link href={`/products/${product.Slug}`} target="_blank">
  <Button size="sm" title="View Product" variant="ghost">
    <Eye className="h-4 w-4" />
  </Button>
</Link>
```

**After:**
```tsx
{product.IsActive ? (
  <Link href={`/products/${product.Slug}`} target="_blank">
    <Button size="sm" title="View Product" variant="ghost">
      <Eye className="h-4 w-4" />
    </Button>
  </Link>
) : (
  <Button
    size="sm"
    title="Product is inactive - activate it first to view publicly"
    variant="ghost"
    disabled
    className="opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed"
  >
    <Eye className="h-4 w-4" />
  </Button>
)}
```

### Why This Works

- **Active products:** View button works as before - opens public product page
- **Inactive products:** View button is disabled with helpful tooltip
- **User guidance:** Tooltip tells admin to activate product first
- **Prevents confusion:** No more "Product Not Found" errors

## üí° Why Products Are Copied as Inactive

This is **intentional design** for safety and quality control:

1. **Review Before Publishing**
   - Copied products may need adjustments
   - Name usually needs changing (contains "(Copy)")
   - Pricing might need review
   - Descriptions might need updating

2. **Prevent Customer Confusion**
   - Avoids duplicate products appearing live
   - Prevents customers from ordering wrong product
   - Gives admin time to customize

3. **Best Practice**
   - Review and edit the copy
   - Update name, SKU, and details
   - Activate only when ready

### Admin Product List
- **`/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`** - Admin product management

### Customer Product Page
- **`/src/app/(customer)/products/[slug]/page.tsx`** - Public product display

## üìä Database Check

To see copied products in database:

```bash
PGPASSWORD='GangRun2024Secure' psql -U gangrun_user -d gangrun_db -h localhost -p 5435 -c "SELECT id, name, slug, \"isActive\" FROM \"Product\" WHERE slug LIKE '%copy%' ORDER BY \"createdAt\" DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

Example output:
```
id                                  | name                                  | slug                                        | isActive
