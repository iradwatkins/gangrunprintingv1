# üî¥ LIVE MONITORING ACTIVE

**Started:** October 16, 2025 02:14 UTC
**Status:** WATCHING FOR YOUR TEST

## What I'm Monitoring

1. **Container Logs** - Every API request, error, success
2. **Database Product Count** - Updates every 2 seconds
3. **Latest Products** - Shows 5 most recent products
4. **API Responses** - All status codes and errors

## Current Baseline

- **Products in Database:** 12
- **Container Status:** Running and healthy
- **API Status:** Ready to receive requests

## What To Look For

### ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL Product Creation

```
[POST /api/products] Creating product...
[POST /api/products] Product created: {id}
```

### ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL Image Upload

```
[POST /api/products/upload-image] Uploading image...
[POST /api/products/upload-image] Image uploaded: {url}
```

### ‚ùå FAILED - Unauthorized

```
[POST /api/products] Unauthorized attempt
```

**This means:** Browser still not sending cookies (may need hard refresh)

### ‚ùå FAILED - Validation Error

```
[POST /api/products] Validation failed: {error}
```

**This means:** Missing required fields

## Ready!

**Go ahead and test now. I'm watching everything in real-time.**

I'll see:

- When you submit the form
- If authentication works
- If product is created
- If there are any errors
- When product count increases

**Test away!** üöÄ
