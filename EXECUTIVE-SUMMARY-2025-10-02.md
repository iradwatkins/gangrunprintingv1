---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: Database Migration Not Run üî¥
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Impact:** Orders exist but invisible in admin due to old statuses

**Current State:**
- Database has 17 old manufacturing statuses (PAID, PRINTING, etc.)
- New admin system expects 13 broker statuses (CONFIRMATION, PRODUCTION, etc.)
- Existing orders (e.g., GRP-689757) have status "PAID" (old)
- Admin dashboard filters don't recognize old statuses

**Solution:** Run migration (Phase 1 of deployment checklist)

---

### Issue #2: Customer Orders Page is Stub üî¥
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Impact:** Customers cannot view their orders

**Current State:**
```typescript
// /account/orders/page.tsx (31 lines)
<p>You haven't placed any orders yet</p>  // HARDCODED!
```

**What's Missing:**
- Database query to fetch user's orders
- Order list display
- Filtering (status, date, search)
- Sorting (date, amount)
- Pagination
- Links to order details

**Solution:** Implement Story 4.3 (Phase 3 of deployment checklist)

---

### Issue #3: Limited Test Coverage üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Lower deployment confidence

**Current Coverage:** ~20%
**Target Coverage:** >60%

**Solution:** Write tests during Story 4.3 implementation

---

### Issue #4: Email Confirmations Not Sent üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM (indirect impact)
**Impact:** Customers don't receive order notifications

**Root Cause:**
- Email system built and ready ‚úÖ
- Square webhook expects new status flow ‚úÖ
- But old statuses used (PAID instead of CONFIRMATION) ‚ùå
- Email trigger doesn't fire

**Solution:** Runs automatically after migration (Issue #1 fix)

---

## ü§ù BROKER SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### Architecture Status: ‚úÖ PERFECT

**What's Built:**
- ‚úÖ Database schema (`User.isBroker`, `User.brokerDiscounts`)
- ‚úÖ Pricing engine with broker discount logic
- ‚úÖ Pricing API accepts broker parameters
- ‚úÖ Frontend display shows broker discounts
- ‚úÖ Unit tests verify 10% discount works

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå Admin UI to configure broker customers (Story 5.7)
- ‚ùå Frontend doesn't pass user broker status to pricing API
- ‚ùå No broker customers exist in database (can't be created yet)

**Business Model Support:**
- ‚úÖ 95% retail / 5% broker customer mix
- ‚úÖ Category-specific discounts (15% off Business Cards, 20% off Flyers)
- ‚úÖ Flexible discount percentages
- ‚úÖ Transparent discount display
- ‚úÖ Works with existing pricing/checkout

**Recommendation:**
Fix orders first (Issues #1 & #2), then build Story 5.7 (Broker UI)

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### Immediate (Next 30 Minutes)
**Phase 1: Run Database Migration**
```bash
cd /root/websites/gangrunprinting
./run-migration.sh
npx prisma generate
pm2 restart gangrunprinting
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Orders visible in admin dashboard
- ‚úÖ Status transitions work
- ‚úÖ Email confirmations start sending
- ‚úÖ No data loss

**Risk:** LOW (migration has automatic backup + rollback plan)

---

### High Priority (Next 2-3 Days)
**Phase 2-3: Implement Customer Orders Page**

**Story 4.3 Development:**
- Assign developer
- Estimated: 12-16 hours
- Follow detailed story documentation
- Include all 20 acceptance criteria
- Write E2E tests

**Expected Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Customers can view their orders
- ‚úÖ Filtering, search, sort work
- ‚úÖ Production blocker removed
- ‚úÖ System usable by customers

**Risk:** MEDIUM (complex feature, needs thorough testing)

---

### Medium Priority (Next 1-2 Weeks)
**Story 5.7: Broker Discount UI**

**After orders working, build:**
- Admin broker list page (`/admin/brokers`)
- Discount configuration modal
- Category-specific discount inputs
- API: `PUT /api/admin/users/[id]/broker-discounts`

**Estimated:** 6-8 hours

---

### Ongoing
**Increase Test Coverage**
- Target: >60% coverage
- Focus on critical paths (checkout, orders, payment)
- Story-012 from remaining-work.md

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS & LEARNINGS

### 1. Documentation Drift
**Issue:** Story 4.3 marked complete when only stub existed
**Learning:** Need better verification process
**Solution:** QA reviews should check actual implementation, not just docs

### 2. Retrospective Documentation Value
**Issue:** Major feature (Story 5.8) built but undocumented
**Learning:** Even completed work needs formal documentation
**Solution:** Create retrospective stories for brownfield projects

### 3. Migration Dependencies
**Issue:** Multiple features depend on migration being run
**Learning:** Infrastructure changes need coordinated deployment
**Solution:** Clear deployment checklists with dependency tracking

### 4. Broker System Architecture
**Insight:** Backend perfectly architected for broker model
**Learning:** Good separation of concerns pays off
**Result:** Frontend integration will be straightforward

## üìû QUESTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS

**Q1: Can we deploy Story 5.8 without running migration?**
**A1:** No. Migration is required for admin to see orders correctly.

**A2:** Not recommended. Story 4.3 is a production blocker affecting all customers.

**Q3: What if migration fails?**
**A3:** Automatic backup created. Rollback procedure in deployment checklist.

**Q4: How long until customers can see orders?**
**A4:** Migration: 30 min ‚Üí Story 4.3 development: 2-3 days ‚Üí Testing: 1 day = **3-4 days total**

**Q5: Is the broker system ready for first broker customer?**
**A5:** Backend yes, frontend no. Need Story 5.7 (broker UI) and frontend integration (4 hours).
