# Product Activity Monitoring - Instructions

## ‚úÖ Monitor is Currently Running!

The enhanced monitoring script is **actively watching** all product and order activity on gangrunprinting.com.

## What It's Monitoring

The script is capturing and analyzing:

- ‚úÖ **Product Creation** - All create product attempts
- ‚úÖ **Product Updates** - Edit and update operations
- ‚úÖ **Product Deletion** - Delete operations
- ‚úÖ **Image Uploads** - File uploads to MinIO
- ‚úÖ **Authentication** - Session cookies, login status
- ‚úÖ **Database Operations** - Prisma queries, inserts, updates
- ‚úÖ **API Errors** - Failed requests, validation errors
- ‚úÖ **Network Issues** - Connection problems

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Perform Your Actions

Go ahead and test the system:

1. **Create a Product**
   - Go to: https://gangrunprinting.com/admin/products/new
   - Fill in product details
   - **Upload an image** (this is where you said it fails)
   - Click "Save" or "Create Product"

2. **Try to Save/Update**
   - Edit an existing product
   - Try uploading images
   - Save changes

3. **Create an Order** (if applicable)
   - Go through the order creation flow
   - Upload any customer files

### Step 2: Check the Live Output

To see what's being captured in real-time:

```bash
tail -f product-activity-detailed-*.log
```

This will show you live events as they happen.

### Step 3: Stop Monitoring & Get Report

When you're done testing, run:

```bash
# Find the monitoring process
ps aux | grep "monitor-product-detailed"

# Kill it (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill [PID]
```

Or I can stop it for you and generate the analysis report.

## Log Files Generated

The monitor creates two files:

1. **`product-activity-detailed-[timestamp].log`**
   - Raw chronological log of all events
   - Timestamped entries
   - Easy to read

2. **`product-activity-analysis-[timestamp].json`**
   - Structured analysis data
   - Event categorization
   - Error summaries
   - Statistics

## What Happens After

Once you stop the monitor, you'll get an **automatic diagnostic report** showing:

- üìä Total events captured
- üî® Product creation attempts (success/failure)
- üñºÔ∏è Image upload attempts (success/failure)
- ‚ùå All errors categorized by type:
  - Authentication errors
  - Database errors
  - Storage/MinIO errors
  - Network errors
  - Validation errors
- üîê Authentication issues detected
