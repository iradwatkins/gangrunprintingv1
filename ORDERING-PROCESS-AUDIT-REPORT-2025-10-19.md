# Ordering Process Audit Report

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Scope:** Complete customer ordering flow from product selection to payment

---

## Executive Summary

### Critical Issue Found & FIXED ‚úÖ

**Issue:** Cart "Continue to Payment" button was completely non-functional, preventing ALL customer orders.

**Root Cause:** Button handler only showed a toast message with TODO comment instead of navigating to checkout.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `/src/app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx:47-60` to navigate to shipping page.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Customers can now proceed past cart.

---

## Complete Ordering Flow Analysis

### ‚úÖ WORKING: Product Detail Page

**Location:** `/src/app/(customer)/products/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Functionality:**

- ‚úÖ Product configuration loads via server-side fetch (with client-side fallback)
- ‚úÖ Pricing calculates correctly based on selections
- ‚úÖ "Add to Cart" button functional (line 82-89 of AddToCartSection.tsx)
- ‚úÖ Redirects to `/checkout` after adding to cart

**Code Reference:** `AddToCartSection.tsx:85` - `router.push('/checkout')`

---

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Cart Page

**Location:** `/src/app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx`

**Original Issue (Line 47-61):**

```typescript
const handleContinueToPayment = () => {
  // TODO: Implement payment flow
  toast.success('Proceeding to payment...')
  // For now, just show a message
}
```

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
const handleContinueToPayment = () => {
  if (items.length === 0) {
    toast.error('Your cart is empty')
    return
  }

  // Store uploaded files
  if (uploadedFiles.length > 0) {
    sessionStorage.setItem('cart_artwork_files', JSON.stringify(uploadedFiles))
  }

  // Navigate to shipping address and method selection
  router.push('/checkout/shipping')
}
```

**Current Functionality:**

- ‚úÖ Displays cart items with product details
- ‚úÖ Shows artwork upload section
- ‚úÖ Calculates subtotal, tax (placeholder), and total
- ‚úÖ "Continue to Payment" button NOW WORKS - navigates to shipping
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Page title says "Checkout" but URL is `/checkout` (could be confusing)

---

### ‚úÖ NEW: Shipping Selection Page
