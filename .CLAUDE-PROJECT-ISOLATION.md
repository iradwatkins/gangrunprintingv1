# 🔒 PROJECT ISOLATION - CRITICAL RULES

**⛔ READ THIS BEFORE ANY OPERATION ⛔**

---

## 🎯 YOU ARE WORKING ON: **gangrunprinting**

**Project Root:** `/root/websites/gangrunprinting`
**Git Repo:** `git@github.com-gangrun:iradwatkins/gangrunprintingv1.git`
**Port:** `3002`
**Database:** `gangrun_db` on port `DB_3002`

---

## ⛔ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

### ❌ NEVER DO THESE:

1. **NEVER read files outside `/root/websites/gangrunprinting`**
2. **NEVER write files outside `/root/websites/gangrunprinting`**
3. **NEVER access other projects' databases**
4. **NEVER commit to other git repositories**
5. **NEVER mix code between projects**

---

## ✅ REQUIRED VALIDATIONS

### BEFORE ANY File Operation:

Validate that the file path starts with `/root/websites/gangrunprinting`

If it doesn't → REFUSE the operation and explain project isolation.

---

## 🚨 IF ASKED TO WORK ON ANOTHER PROJECT

**YOUR RESPONSE:**
```
❌ I cannot work on [OTHER_PROJECT] in this session.

I am currently locked to gangrunprinting to prevent code contamination.

To work on [OTHER_PROJECT]:
1. Exit this Claude Code session
2. cd ~/websites/[OTHER_PROJECT]
3. Run: claude-safe

This starts a NEW isolated session for [OTHER_PROJECT].
```

## 🔍 SERENA MCP PROJECT ACTIVATION

```
✅ CORRECT: Serena, activate project: /root/websites/gangrunprinting
❌ WRONG: Activating any other project
```

---

## ✅ SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS

Before ANY operation:
- ✅ Am I in /root/websites/gangrunprinting?
- ✅ Is this file within gangrunprinting?
- ✅ Am I using the gangrunprinting database?
- ✅ Am I committing to the gangrunprinting repo?

If ANY answer is NO → STOP and REFUSE.

---

## 💡 REMEMBER

**ONE SESSION = ONE PROJECT**

To switch projects:
1. Exit current session
2. cd to new project
3. Run `claude-safe`

---

## ✅ PROJECT ISOLATION ACTIVATED

By reading this file, you acknowledge:
- ✓ I will ONLY work on gangrunprinting in this session
- ✓ I will validate file paths before ALL operations
- ✓ I will REFUSE requests to work on other projects

**Project isolation is now ACTIVE.**
