## ✈️ Southwest Cargo Integration

### Database Status

- **82 active airports** loaded and ready
- Verified via: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Airport" WHERE carrier='SOUTHWEST_CARGO'`

### How It Works

**For States WITH Southwest Service** (TX, CA, AZ, IL, etc.):

1. Customer enters address in Texas
2. Shipping rates auto-load showing:
   - ✈️ Southwest Cargo Pickup ($XX.XX, 3 days)
   - ✈️ Southwest Cargo Dash ($XX.XX, 1 day)
   - 🚚 FedEx Ground ($XX.XX, X days)
   - 🚚 FedEx 2Day ($XX.XX, 2 days)
3. Customer selects Southwest option
4. **Airport selector appears** with dropdown of TX airports
5. Customer picks preferred airport (DFW, DAL, HOU, etc.)
6. Order stores airport ID for fulfillment

**For States WITHOUT Southwest Service** (FL, NY, NC, etc.):

1. Customer enters Florida address
2. Only FedEx options appear
3. No Southwest Cargo shown
4. No airport selector
5. Normal checkout continues

### Technical Implementation

- **API:** `/api/shipping/rates` - Returns all applicable carriers
- **API:** `/api/airports?state=TX` - Returns airports for state
- **Provider:** Database-driven (not hardcoded)
- **UI:** Conditional rendering based on selected carrier
