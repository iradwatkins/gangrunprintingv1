# Manual Product Deletion Test

## Fix Deployed
The product deletion fix has been deployed. All fetch() calls now include `credentials: 'include'` to send authentication cookies.

## Files Fixed
1. `/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Line 96: DELETE fetch
2. `/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Line 123: PATCH toggleActive fetch
3. `/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Line 143: PATCH toggleFeatured fetch
4. `/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Line 161: POST duplicate fetch

## Manual Test Steps

### Test 1: Create a Product
1. Go to https://gangrunprinting.com/admin/products/new
2. Fill in product details:
   - Name: "Test Delete Product 1"
   - SKU: "TEST-DEL-001"
   - Base Price: "10.00"
   - Select any category
3. Click "Create Product"
4. **Expected**: Product saves successfully
5. Note the product ID from the URL or products list

### Test 2: Delete the Product
1. Go to https://gangrunprinting.com/admin/products
2. Find "Test Delete Product 1" in the list
3. Click the trash icon (Delete button)
4. Confirm deletion in the popup
5. **Expected**: Product deletes successfully, disappears from list

### Test 3: Repeat 2 More Times
Repeat Test 1 and Test 2 with:
- Test Delete Product 2 (SKU: TEST-DEL-002)
- Test Delete Product 3 (SKU: TEST-DEL-003)

## Verification
- All 3 products should create successfully
- All 3 products should delete successfully
- No authentication errors should appear
- Check browser DevTools Network tab:
  - DELETE request should include `Cookie: auth_session=...` header
  - Response should be 200 OK with `{"message":"Product deleted successfully"}`

## Root Cause (Fixed)
All product management fetch() calls were missing `credentials: 'include'`, preventing the browser from sending the `auth_session` cookie with requests. This caused the API to reject requests as unauthorized even though the user was logged in.

The fix adds `credentials: 'include'` to all authenticated fetch() calls, ensuring cookies are sent.
