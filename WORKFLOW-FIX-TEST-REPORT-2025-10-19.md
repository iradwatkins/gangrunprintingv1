## ❌ KNOWN ISSUES ADDRESSED

### Issue: "Next: Upload Your Design Files" not going to next page

**Root Cause:**
- Old workflow had cart redirecting to `/cart/upload-artwork`
- New workflow removed this step (upload happens BEFORE cart)

**Solution:**
- Updated cart button to redirect to `/checkout` instead
- Changed button text from "Next: Upload Your Design Files" to "Proceed to Checkout"
- Changed helper text to "Your artwork files are ready for checkout"

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 📍 URL MAPPING (PUBLIC)

All URLs are accessible via domain:

```
Product Pages:
→ http://gangrunprinting.com/products
→ http://gangrunprinting.com/products/[slug]

Upload Artwork:
→ http://gangrunprinting.com/upload-artwork (PRIMARY)
→ http://gangrunprinting.com/cart/upload-artwork (FALLBACK - requires cart items)

Shopping Cart:
→ http://gangrunprinting.com/cart

Checkout:
→ http://gangrunprinting.com/checkout
→ http://gangrunprinting.com/checkout/success
```

---

## 📂 TWO UPLOAD PAGES ARCHITECTURE

### Primary: `/upload-artwork` (Standalone)
- **Purpose:** Upload files BEFORE viewing cart
- **Flow:** Product → Upload → Cart
- **Works:** Without cart items (independent)
- **UI:** Simple, focused interface

### Fallback: `/cart/upload-artwork` (Cart-Embedded)
- **Purpose:** Upload files AFTER cart (if customer skipped first upload)
- **Flow:** Product → Cart → Upload → Checkout
- **Requires:** Cart items must exist
- **UI:** Multi-item upload support with progress tracking

---

## 🔐 SESSION STORAGE

Files are stored temporarily in browser sessionStorage:

```javascript
// Standalone upload page
sessionStorage.setItem('uploaded_artwork_files', JSON.stringify(files))

// Cart-embedded upload page (per product)
sessionStorage.setItem(`uploaded_images_${productId}`, JSON.stringify(files))
```

Files are associated with order after successful payment via:
- API endpoint: `/api/orders/[id]/files/associate-temp/route.ts`
- Service: `/lib/services/order-file-service.ts`
