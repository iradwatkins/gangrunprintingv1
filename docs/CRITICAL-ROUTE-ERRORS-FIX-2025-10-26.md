# CRITICAL: Route & Checkout Flow Errors - Fixed October 26, 2025

## 🚨 ERRORS ENCOUNTERED IN PRODUCTION

### **Error 1: CSS MIME Type Error**
```
Refused to execute script from 'https://gangrunprinting.com/_next/static/css/21248b5bbaf20ec3.css'
because its MIME type ('text/css') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
```

**Root Cause:** Next.js build cache corruption or browser extension interference
**Solution:** Clear `.next` build directory and rebuild
**Fix Applied:** `rm -rf .next` + fresh build
**Prevention:** This is usually a client-side browser issue (extensions, cached service workers)

---

### **Error 2: Double Locale Prefix `/en/en`**
```
/en/en?_rsc=okmr1 → 404
/en/en/category/flyer → 404
```

**Root Cause:** External links or browser history including `/en` when it shouldn't
**Analysis:**
- Our routing config uses `localePrefix: 'always'` (correct)
- All internal Link components use relative paths like `/category/flyers` (correct)
- The i18n middleware automatically adds `/en` prefix (correct)
- **Likely cause:** External links pointing to `/en/en/...` or bookmarked URLs

**Solution:** Middleware redirect to handle legacy `/en/en` routes
**Fix Applied:** None needed - this is external/user error, not code issue
**Monitoring:** If this becomes frequent, add middleware redirect:

```typescript
// In middleware.ts, add before intl middleware:
if (pathname.startsWith('/en/en/')) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(pathname.replace('/en/en/', '/en/'), request.url))
}
```

### **Error 3: Checkout Shipping - Missing Address**
```
Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
URL: https://gangrunprinting.com/en/checkout/shipping
Issue: "the address is missing to pull the shipping methods"
```

**Root Cause:** Users accessing `/checkout/shipping` directly without going through checkout flow
**Problem Flow:**
1. User bookmarks `/checkout/shipping` or navigates directly
2. No address in sessionStorage (should come from `/checkout` page)
3. Shipping rate API fails because no address exists

**Solution:** Enforce proper checkout flow order
**Fixes Applied:**

#### **Fix 1: Redirect `/checkout` → `/checkout/shipping` (not `/payment`)**
**File:** `src/app/[locale]/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx`

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
router.push('/checkout/payment')  // ❌ Skipped shipping step
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
router.push('/checkout/shipping')  // ✅ Proper flow
```

#### **Fix 2: Validate Checkout Session on Shipping Page**
**File:** `src/app/[locale]/(customer)/checkout/shipping/page.tsx`

**Added Protection:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (items.length === 0) {
    router.push('/checkout')
    return
  }

  // CRITICAL: Check if checkout session exists
  const checkoutData = sessionStorage.getItem('checkout_cart_data')
  if (!checkoutData) {
    console.warn('[Shipping] No checkout session found - redirecting to /checkout')
    router.push('/checkout')
    return
  }
}, [items, router])
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ User goes to `/checkout` → sees cart
- ✅ User clicks "Continue to Shipping" → goes to `/checkout/shipping`
- ✅ Shipping page validates: cart items + checkout session
- ✅ If either missing → redirect back to `/checkout`
- ❌ User bookmarks `/checkout/shipping` directly → redirected to `/checkout`

## 📊 PROPER CHECKOUT FLOW (ENFORCED)

```
1. /checkout (Cart Review)
   ├─ View cart items
   ├─ Upload artwork (optional)
   └─ Click "Continue to Shipping"
        ↓
2. /checkout/shipping (Address & Shipping Method)
   ├─ Validates: cart items + checkout session
   ├─ Enter/select shipping address
   ├─ Select shipping method
   └─ Click "Continue to Payment"
        ↓
3. /checkout/payment (Payment)
   ├─ Validates: shipping address + shipping method
   ├─ Enter payment details
   └─ Submit order
        ↓
4. /checkout/success (Confirmation)
   └─ Order confirmation page
```

## 🔒 PROTECTION LAYERS

### **Layer 1: sessionStorage Validation**
- `checkout_cart_data` - Created at `/checkout`
- `checkout_shipping_address` - Created at `/checkout/shipping`
- `checkout_shipping_method` - Created at `/checkout/shipping`

### **Layer 2: useEffect Redirects**
- Each page validates required sessionStorage data
- Missing data = redirect to previous step

### **Layer 3: Empty Cart Protection**
- All checkout pages redirect to `/checkout` if `items.length === 0`

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### **Normal Flow:**
- [ ] Add product to cart
- [ ] Go to `/checkout` - should see cart
- [ ] Click "Continue to Shipping" - should go to `/checkout/shipping`
- [ ] Enter address, select shipping - should calculate rates
- [ ] Click "Continue to Payment" - should go to `/checkout/payment`
- [ ] Complete payment - should go to `/checkout/success`

### **Direct Navigation (Protected):**
- [ ] Bookmark `/checkout/shipping` with empty cart → redirects to `/checkout`
- [ ] Navigate to `/checkout/shipping` without checkout session → redirects to `/checkout`
- [ ] Navigate to `/checkout/payment` without shipping data → redirects to `/checkout/shipping`

### **Browser Back Button:**
- [ ] Complete checkout → press back → stay on success page (no double-processing)
- [ ] On shipping page → press back → return to `/checkout` (cart page)
- [ ] On payment page → press back → return to `/checkout/shipping`

## 🔍 MONITORING

**Watch for these issues:**
1. `/en/en` routes appearing in logs → investigate external links
2. Users complaining about checkout redirect loops → sessionStorage issues
3. "Could not establish connection" errors → missing validation

**Analytics to track:**
- Checkout abandonment at shipping step
- Direct `/checkout/shipping` access attempts
- Redirect rate from shipping → checkout
