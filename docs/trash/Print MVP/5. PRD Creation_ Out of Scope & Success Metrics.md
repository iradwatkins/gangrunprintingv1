5**. PRD Creation: Out of Scope & Success Metrics\*\***

This section clearly defines the boundaries of the MVP by listing what will not be built in the initial launch. It also establishes the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the platform post-launch, based on the goals outlined in the \`Project Brief\`.

\`\`\`markdown  
\#\# 5\. Out of Scope

To ensure focus and a timely launch of the core product, the following features are explicitly designated as out of scope for the Phase 1 MVP. They will be logged in the backlog for future consideration.

\* \*\*Mega Menu Navigation:\*\* The initial launch will use the simple dropdown navigation style only. The "mega menu" option is deferred.  
\* \*\*One-Page Checkout:\*\* The initial launch will use the multi-step checkout process. The "one-page" checkout option is deferred.  
\* \*\*Post-Purchase Upsells:\*\* The "Thank You" page will not include a post-purchase upsell feature for the MVP.  
\* \*\*Downloadable Artwork Templates:\*\* The product page will direct users to email for templates rather than providing downloadable files.

\#\# 6\. Success Metrics

The success of the platform will be evaluated based on its ability to achieve the core business goals of customer acquisition, transaction volume, and user satisfaction. The following KPIs will be tracked:

\* \*\*Adoption & Engagement:\*\*  
    \* \*\*User Registrations:\*\* The total number of new customer and broker accounts created.  
    \* \*\*Order Volume:\*\* The total number of successful orders processed through the platform.

\* \*\*Conversion & Commercial:\*\*  
    \* \*\*Website Conversion Rate:\*\* The percentage of visitors who complete a purchase.  
    \* \*\*Average Order Value (AOV):\*\* The average monetary value of each order.  
    \* \*\*Cart Abandonment Rate:\*\* The percentage of users who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase.

\* \*\*User Experience & Satisfaction:\*\*  
    \* \*\*Re-order Rate:\*\* The percentage of orders that are generated using the "Re-Order" functionality in the customer account section, indicating customer satisfaction and convenience.  
    \* \*\*Customer Support Inquiries:\*\* A reduction in inquiries related to order status or product configuration, indicating a clear and intuitive user interface.
