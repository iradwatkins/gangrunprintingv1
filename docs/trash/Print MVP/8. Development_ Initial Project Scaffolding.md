**8\. Development: Initial Project Scaffolding\*\***

This step covers the creation of the project's foundational structure as defined in **\*\*Epic 1\*\*** and the technical guidelines. It involves setting up the repositories and creating the initial frontend application shell.

**\*\*Actions Taken:\*\***

1\. **\*\*Repository Setup:\*\*** A polyrepo structure is being initiated on GitHub, with one repository for the frontend and another for any potential custom backend services.  
2\. **\*\*Backend Initialization:\*\*** A new project is being provisioned in Supabase, which will provide our PostgreSQL database, authentication, file storage, and serverless function capabilities as our primary BaaS.  
3\. **\*\*Frontend Project Scaffold:\*\*** The frontend application is being created using Vite with the React and TypeScript template, as specified in the technical guidelines.

The command used for frontend creation is:  
\`npm create vite@latest frontend-app \-- \--template react-ts\`

After initialization and installation of core dependencies, the resulting frontend directory structure is created as mandated by the \`Frontend-Architecture.md\` document:
