\# Product Requirements Document: Custom E-commerce Printing Platform

\#\# 1\. Goals and Background Context

\#\#\# 1.1. Goals

\* The core of the project is to develop a bespoke e-commerce platform specifically designed for selling highly configurable printing products online.  
\* The platform will operate on a vendor-broker model, where the business acts as the primary printer/interface to the customer, while actual print production is outsourced to various external vendors.  
\* The goal is to build a comprehensive, feature-rich e-commerce platform that includes advanced product configuration, dynamic pricing, a full suite of marketing automation and CRM capabilities, and a flexible, white-label-ready architecture.  
\* Development will proceed in prioritized phases to ensure a systematic rollout.

\#\#\# 1.2. Background Context

This brief serves as the master summary of all key requirements, features, and scope decisions for the platform. It acts as the primary source of truth for all subsequent design and development phases. The platform will serve end customers (individuals and businesses), brokers (resellers or trade clients), and administrators (site owners and staff).
