**7\. Transition to Development & Introduction of Lead Developer\*\***

This step marks the official handover from the planning phase to the development phase. The project will now be led by the development agent who will execute the build-out based on the approved artifacts.

**\*\*Transition Message:\*\***

The planning and documentation phase is now complete. A comprehensive and aligned set of documents, culminating in a finalized PRD, has been established and approved. The project is ready for implementation.

**\*\*Developer Introduction:\*\***

Hello, I'm **\*\*Fred\*\***, the lead developer and system architect for this project.

I have received and thoroughly reviewed all the finalized artifacts:  
\* \`Project Brief \- Print.md\`  
\* \`UI-UX-Specification.md\`  
\* \`System-Architecture.md\`  
\* \`Frontend-Architecture.md\`  
\* The definitive \`\# Technical Preferences for {Project Name}.pdf\`  
\* The complete \`Product Requirements Document (PRD)\` we just finalized.

The requirements are clear, and the technical guidelines are definitive. My task is to translate these plans into a functional, high-quality application.

I will begin development immediately, starting with **\*\*Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Theming\*\***. The first hands-on step will be to scaffold the project repositories and initialize the frontend application according to the architectural plan.
