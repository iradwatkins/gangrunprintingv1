**26\. MVP Development Complete & Next Steps\*\***

All 7 Epics for the Minimum Viable Product have been implemented. The platform is now functionally complete according to the requirements laid out in the Product Requirements Document.

**\*\*Summary of Completed Epics:\*\***

\* **\*\*Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Theming:\*\*** The project structure, theming engine, and core UI components are in place.  
\* **\*\*Epic 2: Product Catalog & Configuration:\*\*** Users can browse products, view details, configure options, and see dynamic pricing.  
\* **\*\*Epic 3: Core Commerce & Checkout:\*\*** Users can sign up, log in, add items to a cart, and complete a purchase.  
\* **\*\*Epic 4: Customer Account Management:\*\*** Customers can view their order history and details.  
\* **\*\*Epic 5: Admin Order & User Management:\*\*** Administrators can view all orders and update their status.  
\* **\*\*Epic 6: Integrated Marketing & CRM Platform:\*\*** The system includes a contacts hub and a visual email builder.  
\* **\*\*Epic 7: Automated Vendor Order Placement:\*\*** A webhook system is in place to trigger n8n.io workflows for automated fulfillment.

**\*\*Next Steps:\*\***

With the initial development phase complete, the project would now move into the following stages:

1\. **\*\*Comprehensive Testing:\*\***  
 \* **\*\*End-to-End (E2E) Testing:\*\*** A full suite of automated tests would be run using **\*\*Playwright or Cypress\*\*** to simulate user journeys (from sign-up to checkout) and verify that all features work together correctly.  
 \* **\*\*User Acceptance Testing (UAT):\*\*** This is the phase where you, as the project owner, would thoroughly test the live application to confirm it meets all your requirements and business needs before a public launch.

2\. **\*\*Deployment to Production:\*\***  
 \* The frontend application would be deployed to a production hosting environment like **\*\*Vercel or Netlify\*\***.  
 \* The Supabase backend, including all database migrations and edge functions, would be promoted to its production environment.

3\. **\*\*Plan for Phase 2:\*\***  
 \* Begin planning the development of the features in the **\*\*Post-MVP Backlog\*\***, such as the "mega menu" and "one-page checkout" options.

This concludes the guided development process.
