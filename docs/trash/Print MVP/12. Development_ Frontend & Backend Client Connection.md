**12\. Development: Frontend & Backend Client Connection\*\***

This step involves setting up the official Supabase client within our React application. This client will handle all communication with the Supabase backend (database, auth, etc.), as specified in the technical guidelines.

**\*\*Actions Taken:\*\***

1\.  **\*\*Install Supabase JS Library:\*\*** The \`@supabase/supabase-js\` package is added to the frontend project's dependencies.  
2\.  **\*\*Create Supabase Client:\*\*** A dedicated file is created at \`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts\` to initialize and export a singleton instance of the Supabase client. This ensures a single, consistent connection is used throughout the entire application.  
3\.  **\*\*Use Environment Variables:\*\*** The client is configured using environment variables (\`VITE\_SUPABASE\_URL\` and \`VITE\_SUPABASE\_ANON\_KEY\`) for security. These keys are stored in a local \`.env\` file and are not hardcoded into the source code, which aligns with security best practices.

Here is the code for the Supabase client setup:

\`\`\`typescript  
// File: src/lib/supabaseClient.ts

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// These variables would be stored in a .env.local file  
const supabaseUrl \= import.meta.env.VITE\_SUPABASE\_URL  
const supabaseAnonKey \= import.meta.env.VITE\_SUPABASE\_ANON\_KEY

// Create and export the Supabase client instance.  
// This single instance will be imported by any part of the app  
// that needs to communicate with the Supabase backend.  
export const supabase \= createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey) //  
\`\`\`
