## Recent Updates

### 2025-10-19: Dedicated Cart Page with Artwork Upload

**Change**: Created dedicated `/cart` page with drag-and-drop file upload
**Files Created**:

- `/src/app/(customer)/cart/page.tsx` - Full cart page with upload section

**Files Modified**:

- `/src/components/product/AddToCartSection.tsx` - Redirect to /cart instead of opening drawer
- `/src/contexts/cart-context.tsx` - Removed auto-open drawer on ADD_ITEM action

**New Flow**:

```
Product Page â†’ Add to Cart â†’ /cart Page (with upload) â†’ Checkout
```

**Features Implemented**:

- âœ… Full cart page with responsive layout
- âœ… Drag & drop artwork upload section (ArtworkUpload component)

- âœ… Order summary (subtotal, tax, shipping, total)
- âœ… sessionStorage integration for uploaded files
- âœ… "Proceed to Checkout" button
- âœ… Empty cart state with "Browse Products" CTA

**Reason**: Better UX for file uploads - drawer too small for drag-and-drop interface
**Impact**: Improved upload experience, clearer order review process, standard e-commerce pattern

**Deployment**:

- âœ… Build Status: Successful (no TypeScript errors)
- âœ… Route Created: `/cart` - 7.64 kB (First Load: 137 kB)
- âœ… Deployed to Production: 2025-10-19 15:10 CST

- âœ… Live URL: https://gangrunprinting.com/cart

### 2025-10-19: Cart Drawer UX Enhancement

**Change**: Reordered shipping estimate to display above checkout button
**File Modified**: `/src/components/cart/cart-drawer.tsx`
**Reason**: Improved user experience - shipping cost visibility before checkout decision
**Impact**: Better conversion rates expected due to transparent pricing flow
