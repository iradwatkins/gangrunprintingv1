# Admin Products Page Rendering Fix

## Issue Date

September 18, 2025

## Problem Description

The admin products page at `/admin/products/new` was showing blank content areas. The sidebar loaded but the main content area remained empty.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Authentication API Bug**: The `/api/product-categories` route had incorrect authentication check - used `session.user.role` instead of `user.role`

2. **Missing Authentication**: The `/api/add-ons` route was missing authentication checks entirely for the POST endpoint

3. **Race Condition**: The `useApiBundle` hook was fetching data immediately before authentication was confirmed, causing API calls to fail or timeout

4. **Timeout Conflicts**: Both AdminAuthWrapper and API calls had 10-second timeouts that could conflict

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Authentication Checks

- Updated `/api/product-categories/route.ts` to use `user.role` instead of `session.user.role`
- Added authentication check to `/api/add-ons/route.ts` POST endpoint
- Ensured all API routes consistently check for both session and user before verifying admin role

### 2. Enhanced AdminAuthWrapper Component

- Added AuthContext to provide authentication state to child components
- Added `useAdminAuth` hook for accessing auth state
- Improved error handling with console logging for debugging
- Added explicit cache prevention for auth status checks

### 3. Updated Data Fetching Logic

- Modified `useApiBundle` hook to accept `enabled` option
- Updated products page to only fetch data when `isAuthorized && !authLoading`
- Fixed useEffect dependencies to properly react to enabled state changes

### 4. Created Comprehensive Tests

- Built extensive Playwright test suite with 9 test scenarios
- Tests cover authentication flow, API access, loading states, timeouts, and error handling
- 43 out of 45 tests passing (only minor loading state tests failing)

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/product-categories/route.ts` - Fixed auth check
2. `/src/app/api/add-ons/route.ts` - Added auth check
3. `/src/components/admin/admin-auth-wrapper.tsx` - Enhanced with context
4. `/src/app/admin/products/new/page.tsx` - Added auth state checking
5. `/src/hooks/use-api.ts` - Added enabled option support
6. `/playwright-tests/admin-products-page.spec.ts` - New test suite

## Test Results

✅ **Working Features:**

- Unauthenticated users correctly redirected to signin
- API endpoints properly secured
- No critical console errors
- Page loads within acceptable time (< 15 seconds)
- Authentication flow working correctly

❌ **Minor Issues:**

- Loading state indicator test failing (non-critical)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run Playwright tests
npx playwright test admin-products-page --reporter=list

# Check application status
pm2 status

# Restart application
PORT=3002 pm2 restart gangrun

# Test authentication API
curl -s https://gangrunprinting.com/api/auth/me | jq .
```

## Prevention Measures

1. Always use `user.role` from validateRequest, not `session.user.role`
2. Ensure all admin API endpoints have authentication checks
3. Use authentication context to coordinate data fetching with auth state
4. Add comprehensive tests for new admin pages
5. Monitor console errors in production
