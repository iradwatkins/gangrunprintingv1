# N8N Marketing Automation Setup Guide

**Complete setup guide for GangRun Printing's Hybrid Marketing Automation System**

---

## Architecture Overview

**Hybrid System:**
- **N8N** - Execution engine (scheduling, cron jobs, error handling)
- **Next.js** - Business logic (API endpoints, email templates, database)
- **PostgreSQL** - Single source of truth (CartSession, Coupon, Order, User)
- **React Email + Resend** - Email rendering and delivery

---

   VALUES (
     'webhook_order_created',
     'Post-Purchase Thank You',
     'https://n8n.agistaffers.com/webhook/order-created',
     'order.created',
     'Send thank you email after order payment'

---

## Phase 3: Next.js Integration

### Update Order API Route

Edit `/src/app/api/orders/route.ts` to trigger N8N webhooks:

```typescript
// After creating order (payment successful)
const webhooks = await prisma.n8NWebhook.findMany({
  where: {
    trigger: 'order.created',
    isActive: true,
  },
})

for (const webhook of webhooks) {
  try {
    await fetch(webhook.url, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        event: 'order.created',
        order: createdOrder,
      }),
    })

    await prisma.n8NWebhook.update({
      where: { id: webhook.id },
      data: {
        lastTriggered: new Date(),
        triggerCount: { increment: 1 },
      },
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Webhook ${webhook.name} failed:`, error)
  }
}
```

2. **Win-back:**
   - Set last order date to 60+ days ago
   - Run workflow manually
   - Verify email received

3. **Anniversary:**
   - Set order date to exactly 1 year ago
   - Run workflow manually
   - Verify email received

4. **Review Request:**
   - Create order and mark as delivered 3 days ago

## Monitoring & Maintenance

**N8N Dashboard:**
- View all workflow executions
- Check success/failure rates
- View error logs

**Database Queries:**

```sql
-- Check webhook trigger counts
SELECT name, trigger, "triggerCount", "lastTriggered"
FROM "N8NWebhook"
ORDER BY "lastTriggered" DESC;

-- Check abandoned carts
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(total)
FROM "CartSession"
WHERE abandoned = true AND recovered = false;

-- Check coupon usage
SELECT code, "usageCount", "usageLimit", "expiresAt"
FROM "Coupon"
WHERE "isActive" = true
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Next.js changes** (API routes, email templates)
2. **Set up N8N workflows** (follow guides above)
3. **Test each workflow** (use testing checklist)
4. **Monitor for 1 week** (check execution logs, email delivery)
5. **Optimize** (adjust timing, copy, discounts based on performance)

---

**CRITICAL:** Always test workflows in sandbox/staging before production!
