# Admin Entities CRUD Testing Story

## Meta
- **Story ID**: ADMIN-CRUD-001
- **Agent Model Used**: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours

## Story
Implement comprehensive testing for all 10 admin entities to ensure complete CRUD operations and duplication functionality work correctly across the entire GangRun Printing admin system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Criteria
- [ ] All 10 admin entities can be created via API and admin interface
- [ ] All entities save correctly to the database with proper validation
- [ ] All entities can be retrieved and displayed with correct formatting
- [ ] All entities can be updated via API and admin interface
- [ ] All entities can be duplicated/cloned via API
- [ ] All entities can be deleted safely with proper cascading
- [ ] All operations maintain data integrity and relationships

### Technical Criteria
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage on admin CRUD operations
- [ ] All Playwright tests pass consistently across multiple runs
- [ ] Database state validation after each operation
- [ ] API response validation for all endpoints
- [ ] UI interaction validation for all admin pages
- [ ] Error handling validation for edge cases

### Entities Under Test
1. **Products** (/admin/products/) - Complex entity with multiple relationships
2. **Categories** (/admin/categories/) - Simple entity with product relationships
3. **Paper Stocks** (/admin/paper-stocks/) - Complex entity with coating/sides relationships
4. **Paper Stock Sets** (/admin/paper-stock-sets/) - Set entity with item relationships
5. **Quantities** (/admin/quantities/) - Simple numerical entity
6. **Sizes** (/admin/sizes/) - Simple dimensional entity
7. **Add-ons** (/admin/add-ons/) - Complex entity with sub-options
8. **Add-on Sets** (/admin/addon-sets/) - Set entity with addon relationships
9. **Turnaround Times** (/admin/turnaround-times/) - Simple entity with pricing
10. **Turnaround Time Sets** (/admin/turnaround-time-sets/) - Set entity with time relationships

## Tasks

### Phase 1: API Endpoint Completion ✅
- [x] Audit existing duplicate/clone endpoints for all entities
- [x] Create missing duplicate endpoints for 7 entities:
  - [x] Product Categories (/api/product-categories/[id]/duplicate)
  - [x] Paper Stocks (/api/paper-stocks/[id]/duplicate)
  - [x] Paper Stock Sets (/api/paper-stock-sets/[id]/duplicate)
  - [x] Quantities (/api/quantities/[id]/duplicate)
  - [x] Sizes (/api/sizes/[id]/duplicate)
  - [x] Add-ons (/api/add-ons/[id]/duplicate)
  - [x] Turnaround Time Sets (/api/turnaround-time-sets/[id]/duplicate)

### Phase 2: Test Suite Development
- [ ] Create comprehensive Playwright test suite for CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement API-level tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement UI-level tests for all admin pages
- [ ] Create data validation tests for all entities
- [ ] Implement duplication tests for all entities
- [ ] Create edge case and error handling tests

### Phase 3: Test Execution & Validation
- [ ] Execute full test suite with coverage reporting
- [ ] Validate database operations and state consistency
- [ ] Performance testing for bulk operations
- [ ] Cross-browser testing for admin interface
- [ ] Generate comprehensive test report

### Phase 4: Documentation & Reporting
- [ ] Document test results and coverage metrics
- [ ] Create maintenance guide for future testing
- [ ] Generate compliance report for stakeholders

## Dev Notes

### Duplicate Endpoint Patterns Implemented

**Simple Pattern** (for entities without complex relationships):
- Auto-generates name with "(Copy N)" suffix
- Increments sortOrder for proper positioning
- Sets isActive to false to prevent conflicts
- Used for: Categories, Quantities, Sizes

**Complex Pattern** (for entities with relationships):
- Uses database transactions for data consistency
- Copies all related entities and configurations
- Maintains relationship integrity
- Used for: Paper Stocks, Paper Stock Sets, Add-ons, Turnaround Time Sets

### Technology Stack
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright + Vitest
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **API**: Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- **UI**: React with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: Lucia Auth for admin access

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories per Entity:

#### 1. API Tests (Direct endpoint testing)
- GET /api/{entity} - List all entities
- POST /api/{entity} - Create new entity
- GET /api/{entity}/[id] - Get specific entity
- PUT /api/{entity}/[id] - Update entity
- DELETE /api/{entity}/[id] - Delete entity
- POST /api/{entity}/[id]/duplicate - Duplicate entity

#### 2. UI Tests (Admin interface interactions)
- Navigate to admin page
- Create entity via form submission
- Edit entity via form updates
- Delete entity via confirmation dialog
- Duplicate entity via admin action
- Validate form validation and error states

#### 3. Integration Tests (Full workflow testing)
- Create → Read → Update → Delete workflow
- Relationship integrity maintenance
- Cascade delete behavior validation
- Bulk operations performance

#### 4. Data Validation Tests
- Required field validation
- Unique constraint validation
- Data type validation
- Relationship constraint validation
