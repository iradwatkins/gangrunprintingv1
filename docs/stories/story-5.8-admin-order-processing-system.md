## Story

**As an** Administrator,
**I want** a comprehensive print broker order management system with status tracking, payment processing, vendor assignment, and email notifications,
**so that** I can efficiently manage the entire order lifecycle from payment to delivery.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **Order Status Management** - 13 broker-specific order statuses implemented (PENDING_PAYMENT, PAYMENT_DECLINED, CONFIRMATION, ON_HOLD, PRODUCTION, SHIPPED, READY_FOR_PICKUP, ON_THE_WAY, PICKED_UP, DELIVERED, REPRINT, CANCELLED, REFUNDED)

2. ✅ **Database Schema** - 18 new tracking fields added to Order model:
   - filesApprovedAt, filesApprovedBy
   - vendorNotifiedAt, internalNotes, customerNotes
   - rushOrder, priorityLevel, tags
   - productionDeadline, estimatedCompletion, estimatedDelivery
   - pickedUpAt, pickedUpBy, deliveredAt
   - reprintReason, originalOrderId, holdReason
   - pickupLocation, pickupInstructions

3. ✅ **Order Service Layer** - Complete OrderService with 6 core methods:
   - processPayment() - Square webhook integration
   - assignVendor() - Print partner assignment
   - updateStatus() - Status transitions with validation
   - updateShipping() - Tracking & carrier info
   - markPickedUp() - Local/airport pickup handling
   - putOnHold() - Quality control workflow

4. ✅ **Payment Processing** - Multiple payment workflows:
   - Square webhook handler for automated payment
   - Manual payment capture for phone orders
   - Invoice generation and sending

5. ✅ **Email Notification System** - Professional React Email templates:
   - Order confirmation (after payment)
   - Production notification (order sent to vendor)
   - Shipping notification (tracking number)
   - On-hold notification (file issues)
   - Ready for pickup (local/airport pickup)

6. ✅ **Admin UI Components** - OrderQuickActions dropdown with:
   - Update status modal
   - Capture payment modal
   - Send invoice modal
   - Add shipping info modal

7. ✅ **API Endpoints** - Complete REST API:
   - POST /api/webhooks/square/payment
   - POST /api/admin/orders/[id]/capture-payment
   - POST /api/admin/orders/[id]/send-invoice
   - POST /api/admin/orders/[id]/shipping
   - PATCH /api/orders/[id]/status
   - POST /api/orders/[id]/assign-vendor

8. ✅ **Database Migration** - Safe migration script with:
   - Automatic backup before migration
   - Status mapping (old manufacturing → new broker)
   - Performance indexes
   - Verification queries

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This feature implements a **print broker order management system**. GangRun Printing operates as a broker that coordinates with vendor partners for production while maintaining the appearance of a full-service printing company.

### Source Tree

**Service Layer:**

```
src/lib/services/
└── order-service.ts         (OrderService class with 6 methods)
```

**Email System:**

```
src/lib/email/
├── order-email-service.ts   (OrderEmailService with 5 send methods)
└── templates/
    ├── email-layout.tsx     (Base email template)
    ├── order-confirmation.tsx
    └── order-in-production.tsx
```

**Admin UI:**

```
src/components/admin/orders/
└── order-quick-actions.tsx  (423 lines - dropdown with 4 modals)

src/app/admin/orders/
└── page.tsx                 (507 lines - orders table with stats)
```

**API Endpoints:**

```
src/app/api/
├── webhooks/square/payment/route.ts
├── admin/orders/[id]/
│   ├── capture-payment/route.ts
│   ├── send-invoice/route.ts
│   └── shipping/route.ts
└── orders/[id]/
    ├── status/route.ts
    └── assign-vendor/route.ts
```

**Database:**

```
prisma/
└── schema.prisma           (Order model with broker fields)

migrations/
└── migrate-broker-order-system.sql  (125 lines)

run-migration.sh            (79 lines - safe migration runner)
```

### Key Technical Decisions

**1. Status Workflow Design:**

- Eliminated manufacturing statuses (PRINTING, BINDERY, PACKAGING)
- Simplified to broker workflow: CONFIRMATION → PRODUCTION → SHIPPED/READY_FOR_PICKUP → DELIVERED
- Special states: ON_HOLD (file issues), REPRINT (quality issues), PAYMENT_DECLINED

**2. Service Layer Pattern:**

- Created OrderService following ProductService pattern
- All business logic abstracted from API routes
- N8N webhook integration points prepared
- Status transition validation built-in

**3. Email Strategy:**

- React Email for professional templates
- Resend for email delivery
- Trigger points: Payment received, Production start, Shipping, Pickup ready, On hold

**4. Migration Safety:**

- Automatic database backup before migration
- Status mapping: PAID→CONFIRMATION, PRINTING→PRODUCTION, etc.
- Transactional (BEGIN/COMMIT)
- Verification queries included

**5. Admin UX:**

- Quick actions dropdown for efficiency
- Modals for detailed interactions
- Real-time status updates
- Toast notifications for feedback

### Important Notes

**Print Broker Context:**

- System manages orders that are fulfilled by vendor partners
- "Vendor assignment" is a key workflow step
- Production tracking is external (vendor handles)
- Focus on coordination, not manufacturing

**Status Transition Rules:**

```
PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMATION (payment received)
CONFIRMATION → ON_HOLD (file issues)
CONFIRMATION → PRODUCTION (sent to vendor)
PRODUCTION → SHIPPED / READY_FOR_PICKUP / ON_THE_WAY
SHIPPED/ON_THE_WAY → DELIVERED
READY_FOR_PICKUP → PICKED_UP
* → REPRINT (quality issues)
* → CANCELLED (customer request)
* → REFUNDED (after payment)
```

**Email Triggers:**

- Payment → Order Confirmation
- Status: PRODUCTION → Production Notification
- Tracking added → Shipping Notification
- Status: ON_HOLD → On-Hold Notification
- Status: READY_FOR_PICKUP → Pickup Ready

### Dependencies

- Lucia Auth (authentication)
- Square SDK (payment processing)
- Resend (email delivery)
- React Email (email templates)
- Prisma (database ORM)
- N8N (workflow automation - prepared but not yet configured)

### Configuration Required

**Environment Variables:**

```
# Square
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=

# Resend
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

**Migration Deployment:**

```bash
cd /root/websites/gangrunprinting
./run-migration.sh
npx prisma generate
pm2 restart gangrunprinting
pm2 save
```

**Integration Tests (API):**

- [ ] POST /api/webhooks/square/payment verifies signature
- [ ] POST /api/admin/orders/[id]/capture-payment requires auth
- [ ] POST /api/admin/orders/[id]/send-invoice generates PDF
- [ ] PATCH /api/orders/[id]/status rejects invalid transitions
- [ ] POST /api/orders/[id]/assign-vendor notifies vendor

**E2E Tests (Admin Workflow):**

- [ ] Admin can update order status via dropdown
- [ ] Admin can capture payment manually
- [ ] Admin can send invoice email
- [ ] Admin can add shipping tracking
- [ ] Customer receives email after payment
- [ ] Customer receives shipping notification

**Migration Tests:**

- [x] Migration script runs without errors on test database
- [x] Status mapping converts old statuses to new correctly
- [x] Existing orders retain all data
- [x] Indexes are created successfully

**Email Template Tests:**

- [ ] Order confirmation renders correctly
- [ ] Production notification includes vendor info
- [ ] Shipping notification includes tracking link
- [ ] On-hold notification explains issue clearly
- [ ] Pickup notification includes location/instructions

### Test Data Requirements

- Test orders with all status types
- Test Square webhook payloads
- Test vendor records
- Test customer email addresses

A comprehensive audit was performed on 2025-10-02 by Quinn (QA Agent). Key findings:

**Verified Complete (100%):**

- ✅ All 5 email templates implemented
- ✅ All 6 API endpoints exist
- ✅ OrderService with all 6 methods implemented
- ✅ Admin UI component fully functional
- ✅ Database migration script ready

**Gaps Identified:**

- ❌ Database migration not executed (blocker)
- ❌ No automated test coverage for this feature
- ❌ No QA gate review conducted
- ❌ Customer orders page doesn't show orders (separate story needed)

**Production Readiness:** 85/100

- Implementation: 95/100 ✅
- Documentation: 70/100 ⚠️
- Testing: 40/100 ❌
- Quality Gates: 60/100 ⚠️

**Recommendation:**
Deploy to production AFTER:

1. Running database migration in staging
2. Manual testing of complete order flow
3. Verifying email delivery works
4. Creating minimal test suite for critical paths
