# Story 4.3: Customer Order History with Filtering

## Status

**Ready for Review** ✅

**Story Type:** Feature Implementation (Brownfield - Completing Stub)
**Epic:** Epic 4 - Customer Account Management
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Production Blocker
**Story Points:** 8
**Started:** 2025-10-02
**Completed:** 2025-10-02

---

## Story

**As a** Customer,
**I want** to view my complete order history with filtering and search capabilities,
**so that** I can track my past purchases, check order statuses, and reorder products easily.

---

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

**Current State:**

- Page exists at `/account/orders` but is non-functional stub
- Shows hardcoded "You haven't placed any orders yet" message
- Does NOT fetch orders from database
- AccountWrapper layout component exists and works

**Database Schema:**

```typescript
Order model (Prisma):
- id, orderNumber, referenceNumber
- userId (linked to logged-in user)
- status (13 broker statuses after migration)
- createdAt, paidAt
- subtotal, tax, shipping, total
- shippingAddress, billingAddress
- OrderItem[] (related order items)
```

**Technology Stack:**

- Next.js 15 App Router
- Server Components for data fetching
- Prisma ORM for database queries
- Lucia Auth for user authentication
- shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Badge, etc.)

**Integration Points:**

- Authentication: `validateRequest()` from `@/lib/auth`
- Database: `prisma` from `@/lib/prisma`
- Existing layout: `AccountWrapper` component
- Order detail: Links to `/account/orders/[id]` (Story 4.4)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. ✅ **Page exists** at `/account/orders` (already done, needs implementation)

2. ❌ **Fetch user's orders from database**
   - Server component fetches orders for authenticated user
   - Query: `prisma.order.findMany({ where: { userId }, include: { OrderItem: true } })`
   - Handle authentication check (redirect to login if not authenticated)
   - Order by `createdAt DESC` (newest first)

3. ❌ **Display paginated order list**
   - Show 10 orders per page
   - Pagination controls at bottom
   - Loading skeleton while fetching
   - Display order cards with:
     - Order number (e.g., "GRP-689757")
     - Order date (formatted: "Oct 2, 2025")
     - Status badge with color coding
     - Total amount ($XXX.XX)

     - Order items' product names
   - Clear search button
   - Show "No results found" message if empty

7. ❌ **Sort options**
   - Sort dropdown with options:
     - Date (Newest First) [default]

   - Order date (human-readable)
   - Status badge (color-coded by status)
   - Total amount (formatted currency)
   - Item count
   - First product image thumbnail

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This is a **customer-facing feature** in the account management section. It complements the **admin order management** (Story 5.8) by giving customers self-service access to their order history.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Server Component Pattern:**
   - Use Next.js 15 Server Components for data fetching
   - Fetch orders server-side for better performance and SEO
   - Pass data to client components for interactivity

2. **Database Query Strategy:**
   - Single query with `include: { OrderItem: true }` for efficiency
   - Apply filters in application layer (not database) for simplicity
   - Consider database-level filtering if performance becomes issue with 1000+ orders

3. **State Management:**
   - URL as single source of truth for filters/sort/page
   - No need for global state (Redux/Zustand)
   - Use `useSearchParams` for reading, `useRouter().push()` for updating

4. **Status Badges:**
   ```typescript
   const STATUS_COLORS = {
     PENDING_PAYMENT: 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800',
     CONFIRMATION: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800',
     PRODUCTION: 'bg-purple-100 text-purple-800',
     SHIPPED: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800',
     DELIVERED: 'bg-green-600 text-white',
     ON_HOLD: 'bg-orange-100 text-orange-800',
     CANCELLED: 'bg-red-100 text-red-800',
     // ... etc
   }
   ```

### Source Tree

**Page (modify existing):**

```
src/app/account/orders/page.tsx  (currently 31 lines → will be 300+ lines)
```

**New Components (create):**

```
src/components/account/
├── order-card.tsx              (Order display card)
├── order-filters.tsx           (Status, date, search filters)
├── order-sort.tsx              (Sort dropdown)
├── order-pagination.tsx        (Page navigation)
└── order-list-skeleton.tsx     (Loading state)
```

**Utilities (may need to create):**

```
src/lib/utils/
└── date-formatter.ts           (Format order dates)
└── currency-formatter.ts       (Format prices)
```

### Important Implementation Notes

**1. Order Status After Migration:**
After running the migration (Story 5.8), order statuses will be:

- PENDING_PAYMENT, PAYMENT_DECLINED
- CONFIRMATION, ON_HOLD
- PRODUCTION
- SHIPPED, READY_FOR_PICKUP, ON_THE_WAY
- PICKED_UP, DELIVERED
- REPRINT, CANCELLED, REFUNDED

**2. Authentication Flow:**

```typescript
import { validateRequest } from '@/lib/auth'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export default async function OrdersPage() {
  const { user } = await validateRequest()
  if (!user) {
    redirect('/auth/signin?from=/account/orders')
  }

  // Fetch orders...
}
```

**3. Database Query:**

```typescript
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: user.id,
  },
  include: {
    OrderItem: {
      include: {
        // Include product info if needed for thumbnails
      },
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    createdAt: 'desc',
  },
})
```

**4. Broker Discount Display:**
If `user.isBroker === true`, calculate and show savings:

```typescript
// In order card
{user.isBroker && order.brokerDiscountAmount && (
  <Badge variant="success">
    Saved ${order.brokerDiscountAmount.toFixed(2)}
  </Badge>
)}
```

**5. URL State Pattern:**

```typescript
'use client'

import { useSearchParams, useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

function OrderFilters() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()
  const router = useRouter()

  const updateFilter = (key: string, value: string) => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams)
    params.set(key, value)
    router.push(`/account/orders?${params.toString()}`)
  }
}
```

### Dependencies

- ✅ Lucia Auth (authentication)
- ✅ Prisma ORM (database)
- ✅ shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Badge, etc.)
- ⚠️ Date picker component (may need to install or use shadcn DatePicker)
- ⚠️ Pagination component (may need to create or use shadcn Pagination)

### Database Indexes (for performance)

Ensure these indexes exist (should be created by Story 5.8 migration):

```sql
CREATE INDEX "Order_userId_createdAt_idx" ON "Order"("userId", "createdAt");
CREATE INDEX "Order_status_createdAt_idx" ON "Order"("status", "createdAt");
```

### Known Integration Issues

**Issue 1: Migration Must Be Run First**

- Story 5.8 migration creates new order statuses
- This story depends on migration being complete
- If migration not run, status filter will have wrong values

**Issue 2: Order Detail Page (Story 4.4)**

- Epic 4 claims Story 4.4 is complete
- Need to verify `/account/orders/[id]` actually works
- If stub, will need separate implementation

## QA Results

**Status:** ⚠️ Pending Implementation

**QA Agent Notes:**
This story corrects a documentation error where Story 4.3 was marked complete in Epic 4 but only a stub exists. This is a **critical production blocker** as customers cannot currently view their orders.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must be completed before Story 5.7 (Broker UI) or Story 4.5 (Re-Order).

**Dependencies:**

- ⚠️ Story 5.8 database migration must be run first (for correct order statuses)
- ✅ Authentication system working (Lucia Auth)
- ✅ Database schema ready (Order + OrderItem models)

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 12-16 hours
**Estimated Testing Time:** 4-6 hours
