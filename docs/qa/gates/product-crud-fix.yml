root_cause:
  summary: 'fetch() calls missing credentials: include option'
  details: |
    The frontend fetch() calls were not sending cookies with requests because
    the credentials option was not specified. In production (gangrunprinting.com),
    browsers require explicit credential inclusion even for same-origin requests.

    Docker logs showed: "No session ID found in cookies"
    API returned: {"error":"Admin access required","details":{"authError":true}}

    User WAS authenticated (64 active sessions in database), but cookies weren't
    being sent from browser to API.
