## Next Steps (CRITICAL - Complete Within 24 Hours)

### 1. Set Up N8N Workflows

**Documentation:** `/docs/N8N-MARKETING-AUTOMATION-SETUP.md`

**7 Workflows to Create:**

1. **Abandoned Cart (3hr)** - Hourly cron
2. **Abandoned Cart (24hr)** - Hourly cron
3. **Abandoned Cart (72hr)** - Hourly cron
4. **Tiered Abandoned Cart** - Hourly cron (3 branches for $50/$200/$500)
5. **Win-back Campaign** - Daily at 10 AM
6. **Order Anniversaries** - Daily at 9 AM
7. **Review Collection** - Daily at 2 PM

**Webhook Workflows:**
8. **Post-Purchase Thank You** - Triggered on `order.created`
9. **Order Delivered Review** - Triggered on `order.delivered`

**Access N8N:**
- URL: https://n8n.agistaffers.com
- Follow step-by-step guide in documentation

---

### 2. Add Webhook Triggers to Checkout

**Files to Update:**

**Checkout Route** (wherever order creation happens):
```typescript
import { WebhookService } from '@/lib/services/webhook-service'

// After successful payment and order creation
await WebhookService.triggerOrderCreated(order.id)
```

**Order Status Update Route:**
```typescript
import { WebhookService } from '@/lib/services/webhook-service'

// When updating order status
await WebhookService.triggerOrderStatusChanged(
  order.id,
  oldStatus,
  newStatus
)
```

---

### 3. Seed Initial Webhooks in Database

```sql
-- Run in PostgreSQL
INSERT INTO "N8NWebhook" (id, name, url, trigger, description, "isActive", "createdAt", "updatedAt")
VALUES
  (
    'webhook_order_created',
    'Post-Purchase Thank You',
    'https://n8n.agistaffers.com/webhook/order-created',
    'order.created',
    'Send thank you email immediately after order payment',
    true,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  ),
  (
    'webhook_order_delivered',
    'Review Request',
    'https://n8n.agistaffers.com/webhook/order-delivered',
    'order.delivered',
    'Send review request when order status changes to DELIVERED',
    true,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  );
```
