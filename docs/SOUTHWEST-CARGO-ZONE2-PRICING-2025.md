## Key Insights

### Pricing Crossover at 100 lbs

There's a unique crossover point where:
- **Below 100 lbs:** PICKUP is always cheaper (economy option)
- **Around 100 lbs:** DASH becomes cheaper due to flat-rate pricing
- **Above ~110 lbs:** PICKUP becomes cheaper again

This happens because:
1. DASH has flat $148 for 51-100 lbs (good deal for heavy packages in this range)
2. PICKUP charges $1.03/lb on full weight, making 100 lbs = $163 (more expensive than DASH's $148)
3. Above 110 lbs, DASH's per-pound charges ($1.90/lb over 100) make it more expensive again

### Customer Value Proposition

**For light shipments (0-50 lbs):**
- PICKUP: $60-63 ‚úÖ Best value
- DASH: $100-117 (premium for guaranteed next flight)

**For medium shipments (51-100 lbs):**
- **Around 90-105 lbs:** DASH may be cheaper! (counterintuitive but true)
- Other weights: PICKUP cheaper

**For heavy shipments (110+ lbs):**
- PICKUP: Generally cheaper
- DASH: Premium price for guaranteed service
