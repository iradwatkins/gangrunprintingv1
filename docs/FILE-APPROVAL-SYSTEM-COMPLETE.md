## 🔄 Complete Workflow Implementation

### 1. Customer File Upload Flow

```
Customer → Upload Files → Temporary Storage → File Validation →
Associate with Order → Migrate to Permanent Storage →
Notify Admin via Email → Ready for Proof Creation
```

### 2. Admin Proof Upload Flow

```
Admin → Upload Proof → Temporary Storage → File Validation →
Create OrderFile Record → Migrate to Permanent Storage →
Set Status to WAITING → Notify Customer via Email
```

### 3. Customer Approval Flow

```
Customer → View Proof → Review in Enhanced Preview →

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### File Validation Pipeline

1. **Basic Validation**
   - File type whitelist (PDF, JPG, PNG, AI, PSD, etc.)
   - File size limits (configurable per type)
   - Filename sanitization

2. **Advanced Security**
   - Magic byte signature verification
   - Suspicious pattern detection (scripts, executables)
   - Virus scanning integration (ClamAV ready)
   - Threat level assessment (low/medium/high)

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - File-specific rate limits (count + size)
   - Progressive penalties for violations
   - User/IP-based tracking
   - Automatic cleanup and reset

### Security Configuration

```typescript
// File type limits
MAX_FILE_SIZE_PDF: 50MB
MAX_FILE_SIZE_IMAGE: 25MB
MAX_FILE_SIZE_DESIGN: 100MB

// Rate limits per hour
CUSTOMER_UPLOADS: 10 files, 100MB total
ADMIN_UPLOADS: 50 files, 500MB total

// Progressive penalties
1st violation: Base penalty
2nd violation: +15 minutes
3rd violation: +30 minutes
4th violation: +1 hour
5+ violations: +2 hours
```
