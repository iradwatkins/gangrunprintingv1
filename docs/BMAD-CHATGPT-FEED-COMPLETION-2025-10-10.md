## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Bug Fix #1: Image URL Double-Domain Issue

**Problem:** Image URLs were generated as:

```
https://gangrunprinting.comhttps://gangrunprinting.com/minio/...
```

**Root Cause:** Script assumed all image URLs were relative paths starting with `/`, but some were already full URLs.

**Solution:**

```typescript
function getProductImageUrl(product: any, images: any[]): string {
  const primaryImage = images.find((img) => img.isPrimary)
  const firstImage = images[0]

  if (primaryImage?.Image) {
    const url = primaryImage.Image.url
    // ✅ Check if already full URL before prepending domain
    return url.startsWith('http') ? url : `https://gangrunprinting.com${url}`
  } else if (firstImage?.Image) {
    const url = firstImage.Image.url
    return url.startsWith('http') ? url : `https://gangrunprinting.com${url}`
  }

  return 'https://gangrunprinting.com/images/product-placeholder.jpg'
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and verified in generated feed

### Bug Fix #2: PM2 Process Management

**Problem:** PM2 process stuck in "waiting restart" status with `wait_ready: true`

**Root Cause:** Next.js doesn't send ready signal that PM2 `wait_ready` expects

**Solution:**

```javascript
// ecosystem.config.js
wait_ready: false,  // DISABLED: Next.js doesn't send ready signal
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed - PM2 now starts successfully
