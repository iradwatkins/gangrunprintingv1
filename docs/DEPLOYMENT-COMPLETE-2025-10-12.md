## üéì Key Learnings & Decisions

### Why 50 Cities (Not 200)?
**Decision:** Use top 50 US cities by population
**Rationale:**
- Highest market value (18% of US population)
- Easier to monitor and optimize
- Faster AI generation (3-5 minutes vs 15-20 minutes)
- Still massive SEO opportunity
- Can expand to more cities later if needed

### Why `/print/` Prefix?
**Decision:** Use `/print/[productSlug]/[citySlug]` route structure
**Rationale:**
- Resolved conflict with existing `[locale]` route
- SEO-friendly (clearly indicates printing services)
- Organized URL structure
- Future-proof (can add other top-level categories)

### Why Server Components?
**Decision:** Use Next.js 15 Server Components for data fetching
**Rationale:**
- Better SEO (HTML rendered server-side)
- Faster page loads (no client-side fetch delay)
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Improved Core Web Vitals
- Automatic ISR with revalidate setting

### Why Cookie-Based Attribution?
**Decision:** 30-day cookie tracking for order attribution
**Rationale:**
- Simple implementation (no auth required)
- Works for both guests and logged-in users
- Industry-standard attribution window
- Privacy-compliant (no PII in cookies)
- Easy to test and debug
