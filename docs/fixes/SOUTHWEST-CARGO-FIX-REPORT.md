**Date:** 2025-10-12

  - Logs when service is/isn't available for a state
  - Logs weight calculations
  - Logs rate calculations before and after markup
  - Logs final rates being returned

- **Shipping Calculate API** (`src/app/api/shipping/calculate/route.ts`)
  - Logs destination state and ZIP
  - Logs FedEx and Southwest Cargo rate counts
  - Logs full rate details
  - Better error messages with stack traces

### 3. Backend Test Results ‚úÖ

Test with Dallas, TX (guaranteed service area):

- **Product:** 250x 4x6 Postcards on 9pt paper
- **Weight:** 5.40 lbs
- **Result:** SUCCESS

**Rates Returned:**

- FedEx Standard Overnight: $197.04 (1 day)
- FedEx 2Day: $97.03 (2 days)
- FedEx Ground: $21.49 (3 days)
- **Southwest Cargo Pickup: $99.75 (3 days)** ‚úÖ
- **Southwest Cargo Dash: $84.00 (1 day)** ‚úÖ

## Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Browser Testing (Recommended)

1. **Open the checkout page:**

   ```
   https://gangrunprinting.com/checkout
   ```

2. **Add a product to cart first** (required):
   - Go to https://gangrunprinting.com/products
   - Select any product (e.g., Business Cards)
   - Configure options
   - Add to cart
   - Proceed to checkout

3. **Fill in shipping address:**
   - Use a **Texas address** to guarantee Southwest Cargo availability
   - Example:
     ```
     Name: Test User
     Email: test@example.com
     Address: 123 Main Street
     City: Dallas
     State: TX
     ZIP: 75201
     ```

4. **Check the shipping options section:**
   - You should see 5 total rates:
     - 3x FedEx options
     - 2x Southwest Cargo options (Pickup and Dash)

5. **Check browser console** for detailed logs:
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for Southwest Cargo logs

### Option 2: API Testing (Verified Working)

Run the test script:

```bash
node /root/websites/gangrunprinting/test-southwest-shipping.js
```

Expected output:

```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Southwest Cargo is working!
‚úàÔ∏è  Southwest Cargo Options: 2
   - Southwest Cargo Pickup: $99.75 (3 days)
   - Southwest Cargo Dash: $84.00 (1 days)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Southwest Cargo Still Not Showing on Frontend

#### Check 1: Verify Address State

- Southwest Cargo only serves **certain states**
- Most US states are covered, but verify your test address is in TX, CA, FL, etc.
- **Full service area:** AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, PR, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY

#### Check 2: Browser Console Logs

The frontend should show detailed logs:

```
üõ´ [Southwest Cargo] getRates called
   - Destination state: TX
   - Packages: 1 packages
‚úÖ [Southwest Cargo] Service available for TX
üì¶ [Southwest Cargo] Weight calculation:
   - Total weight: 5.4 lbs
üí∞ [Southwest Cargo] Rate calculation:
   - Pickup rate (before markup): $95.00
   - Dash rate (before markup): $80.00
‚úÖ [Southwest Cargo] Returning 2 rates
```

#### Check 3: PM2 Logs

Check server logs in real-time:

```bash
pm2 logs gangrunprinting --lines 50
```

Look for:

- `[Shipping API] üìç Fetching rates for destination:`
- `[Southwest Cargo] getRates called`
- `‚úÖ Southwest Cargo rates received: 2 rates`

#### Check 4: Network Tab

1. Open DevTools > Network tab
2. Fill in shipping address
3. Look for `/api/shipping/calculate` request
4. Check the response - should include Southwest Cargo rates

## Files Modified

1. `/src/lib/shipping/providers/southwest-cargo.ts` - Added logging
2. `/src/app/api/shipping/calculate/route.ts` - Enhanced error logging
3. `/test-southwest-shipping.js` - Created test script

## Next Steps

1. **Test in browser** with a Texas address
2. **If still not showing:**
   - Check browser console logs
   - Check PM2 logs
   - Verify the shipping address form is sending the correct data
   - Check if there's a React state issue preventing the rates from rendering

## Support

If Southwest Cargo still doesn't appear after these steps:

1. Capture browser console logs (F12 > Console)
2. Capture network request/response (F12 > Network > /api/shipping/calculate)
3. Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs gangrunprinting --lines 100 | grep Southwest`
4. Report findings with error messages

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Backend is 100% working** - Southwest Cargo rates are being calculated and returned correctly
‚è≥ **Frontend testing required** - Need to verify checkout page displays the rates

The comprehensive logging added will make it easy to debug any remaining frontend issues.
