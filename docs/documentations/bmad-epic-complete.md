## 🏃 SPRINT 1: EMERGENCY RECOVERY & STABILIZATION

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Fix critical issues and stabilize system

### 📖 STORY 1.1: CRITICAL DATA DISPLAY FIX

**Story Points:** 13  
**Agent:** Backend Agent  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKER

#### USER STORY:

```
AS A user of GangRun Printing
I WANT to see all my data and orders
SO THAT I can use the website normally
```

#### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

- [ ] Data displays correctly on all pages
- [ ] Prisma client synchronized with database
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] No data loss occurs
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<500ms)

#### DEVELOPER NOTES:

```markdown
CRITICAL CONTEXT:

- Next.js 15.5.2 with Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- Data EXISTS in DB but not showing
- Most likely cause: Prisma client desync

TECHNICAL APPROACH:

1. Prisma client regeneration required
2. DATABASE_URL must use 'postgres' not 'localhost' in Docker
3. Connection pooling may need adjustment
4. Schema validation critical
