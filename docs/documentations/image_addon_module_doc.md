# IMAGE ADD-ON MODULE - Testing & Validation Documentation

## Module Overview

**Module Name:** Image Add-on Options  
**Priority Level:** 4 (Fourth Module)  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Complete  
**BMAD Agent Assigned:** **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***  
**Date Started:** **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***  
**Date Completed:** **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***  
**Prerequisites:** Previous 3 modules MUST be 100% complete

---

## Mission Briefing

The Image Add-on Module must function as a completely independent component. A product with ONLY the image add-on options enabled (no quantity, size, paper, turnaround, or any other options) must display perfectly and function without errors. This module handles image uploads, image processing options, and design services.

## Strict Requirements

### Data Requirements

- **FORBIDDEN:** Mock data, test data, simulated data, fake images
- **REQUIRED:** Only real production system data and actual image files
- **Testing Environment:** Production or staging with real data

### Testing Tools

- Chrome DevTools (Primary browser)
- MCP (System interaction)
- Puppeteer (Automated testing)
- Real image files for testing
