# Southwest Cargo Shipping - Fix Summary (October 22, 2025)

## What Was Done

Successfully verified and corrected Southwest Cargo shipping implementation to match the original WooCommerce configuration exactly.

## Issue Found & Fixed

### Problem

The **Southwest Cargo Pickup** service had **3 weight tiers** instead of the **2 tiers** configured in WooCommerce.

**Incorrect Implementation (Before Fix):**

```typescript
pickup: {
  weightTiers: [
    { maxWeight: 50, baseRate: 80, additionalPerPound: 0, handlingFee: 0 },
    { maxWeight: 100, baseRate: 102, additionalPerPound: 1.75, handlingFee: 0 },
    { maxWeight: Infinity, baseRate: 133, additionalPerPound: 1.75, handlingFee: 10 }, // ‚ùå EXTRA TIER
  ],
}
```

**Correct Implementation (After Fix):**

```typescript
pickup: {
  weightTiers: [
    { maxWeight: 50, baseRate: 80, additionalPerPound: 0, handlingFee: 0 },
    { maxWeight: Infinity, baseRate: 102, additionalPerPound: 1.75, handlingFee: 0 }, // ‚úÖ SIMPLIFIED
  ],
}
```

### Impact on Pricing

Heavy packages (101+ lbs) were being overcharged:

| Weight  | Before Fix | After Fix | Difference     |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- |
| 50 lbs  | $80.00     | $80.00    | No change ‚úÖ   |
