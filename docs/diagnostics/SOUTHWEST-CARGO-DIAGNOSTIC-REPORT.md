# Southwest Cargo Airport Display Diagnostic Report

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**QA Agent:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Issue:** 82 Southwest Cargo airports not showing on `/locations` page or checkout

---

## Executive Summary

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Missing `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` configuration

**Impact:** Complete failure of airport display functionality - affects both:
1. `/locations` page - Air Cargo tab shows no airports
2. Checkout flow - Airport selector cannot load locations

**Severity:** **P0 - Critical** (Blocks customer orders using Southwest Cargo shipping)

---

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Tests Completed

1. **Chrome DevTools Test Suite** - Created (`test-southwest-chrome-devtools.js`)
2. **Playwright Test Suite** - Created (`playwright-tests/southwest-cargo-diagnostics.spec.ts`)
3. **Database Diagnostic Script** - Created and executed (`diagnose-southwest-issue.ts`)

### 📊 Diagnostic Results

| Test | Status | Finding |
|------|--------|---------|
| Database Connection | ❌ FAIL | `DATABASE_URL` environment variable not found |
| API Route Implementation | ✅ PASS | `/api/airports/route.ts` correctly implemented |
| Frontend Implementation | ✅ PASS | Locations page fetches from `/api/airports` |
| Hardcoded Data Check | ✅ PASS | No hardcoded airport arrays found |

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing `.env` File

**File:** `.env` (missing)
**Required Variable:** `DATABASE_URL`

**Evidence:**
```
error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL.
  -->  schema.prisma:7
```

**Impact Chain:**
1. No `.env` file → DATABASE_URL undefined
2. Prisma cannot connect to database
3. `/api/airports` endpoint fails when querying database
4. Frontend receives empty response or error
5. No airports display on `/locations` page or checkout

### Secondary Findings

1. **API Route Implementation** ✅ CORRECT
   - File: [src/app/api/airports/route.ts](src/app/api/airports/route.ts)
   - Properly queries `prisma.airport.findMany()`
   - Filters by `isActive: true`
   - Returns JSON with success/airports/count

2. **Frontend Implementation** ✅ CORRECT
   - File: [src/app/(customer)/locations/page.tsx](src/app/(customer)/locations/page.tsx:84)
   - useEffect hook fetches `/api/airports`
   - Sets state with `setAirCargoLocations()`
   - Renders airport cards from state

3. **No Hardcoded Data** ✅ GOOD
   - Confirmed no hardcoded Southwest airport arrays
   - All data dynamically loaded from database
   - Architecture is correct

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

- Local development environment likely has `.env` file
- Production server may have environment variables set differently
- Tests run in CI/local without proper environment configuration

---

## Fixes Required

### Fix 1: Create `.env` File (IMMEDIATE)

**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**File:** `.env`

**Action:** Create `.env` file with database connection string

```bash
# Copy from example
cp .env.example .env

# Or create manually with:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
```

**Specific for GangRun Printing (per CLAUDE.md):**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5435/gangrun_production"

# Per CLAUDE.md:
# - PostgreSQL port: 5435 (dedicated Docker container)
# - Database name: gangrun_production
# - All services in Docker Compose stack
```

### Fix 2: Seed Airport Data (if database is empty)

**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**File:** [src/scripts/seed-southwest-airports.ts](src/scripts/seed-southwest-airports.ts)

**Action:** Run seed script to populate 82 airports

```bash
cd /Users/irawatkins/Documents/Git/New\ Git\ Files\ /gangrunprintingv1
npx tsx src/scripts/seed-southwest-airports.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🛫 Starting Southwest Cargo airport import...
📍 Importing 82 airports...
✅ Imported: ALB - Albany, NY
✅ Imported: ABQ - Albuquerque, NM
... (80 more)
🎉 Airport import complete!
✅ Success: 82 airports
```

### Fix 3: Verify with Diagnostic Script

**Priority:** P1 - High
**File:** `diagnose-southwest-issue.ts`

**Action:** Re-run diagnostic after fixes

```bash
npx tsx diagnose-southwest-issue.ts
```

**Expected Output (after fix):**
```
✅ Database Airport Count - 82 airports
✅ Major Airports Check - All major airports found
✅ Airport Data Structure - All fields present
✅ API Route Check - Correctly implemented
✅ Locations Page Implementation - Fetching from API
```

1. Direct API endpoint test (`/api/airports`)
2. Locations page load test (Air Cargo tab)
3. Checkout airport selector test

**Run with:**
```bash
node test-southwest-chrome-devtools.js
```

**Features:**
- Opens browser with DevTools
- Tracks network requests
- Logs console messages
- Takes screenshots
- Provides manual inspection points

### 2. Playwright Tests
**File:** `playwright-tests/southwest-cargo-diagnostics.spec.ts`

**Tests:**
1. API returns 82 airports
2. Locations page displays all airports
3. Checkout shows airport selector
4. Database query analysis

**Run with:**
```bash
npx playwright test southwest-cargo-diagnostics.spec.ts --headed
```

**Features:**
- Automated UI testing
- Network request monitoring
- Element counting
- Screenshot capture
- Detailed assertions

### 3. Database Diagnostic Script
**File:** `diagnose-southwest-issue.ts`

**Checks:**
1. Database airport count
2. Specific major airports (MDW, ATL, DAL, etc.)
3. Airport data structure
4. Hardcoded location detection
5. API route file validation
6. Frontend implementation validation

**Run with:**
```bash
npx tsx diagnose-southwest-issue.ts
```

## Verification Steps (Post-Fix)

### Step 1: Verify Database Connection
```bash
npx prisma db push
# Should complete without errors
```

### Step 2: Verify Airport Count
```bash
npx tsx diagnose-southwest-issue.ts
# Should show: ✅ Database Airport Count - 82 airports
```

### Step 3: Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3020/api/airports | jq '.count'
# Should return: 82
```

### Step 4: Test Locations Page (Manual)
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3020/locations`
2. Click "Air Cargo Pickup" tab
3. Verify 82 airports are displayed
4. Check state filter works
5. Check search works

### Step 5: Test Checkout (Manual)
1. Add product to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Enter shipping address
4. Select "Southwest Cargo" shipping option
5. Verify airport selector appears
6. Open dropdown - should show 82 airports

## Hard-Coded Location Prevention

### ❌ FORBIDDEN (Per User Request)
```typescript
// DO NOT DO THIS:
const southwestAirports = [
  { code: 'MDW', name: 'Chicago Midway', ... },
  { code: 'ATL', name: 'Atlanta', ... },
  // ... 80 more hardcoded airports
]
```

### ✅ CORRECT PATTERN
```typescript
// DO THIS:
const [airports, setAirports] = useState([])

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/airports')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setAirports(data.airports))
}, [])
```

**Rationale:**
- Southwest Cargo may add/remove airports
- Hardcoded data becomes stale
- Database is single source of truth
- Easy to update via seed script

---

## Architecture Validation

### ✅ Current Implementation (CORRECT)

```
Database (PostgreSQL)
  ↓ Prisma ORM
  ↓
API Route (/api/airports)
  ↓ HTTP GET
  ↓ JSON Response
Frontend (React)
  ↓ fetch() in useEffect
  ↓ setState()
  ↓ Component Re-render
Display (82 airports)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Database** stores 82 Southwest Cargo airports
2. **API Route** queries database, returns JSON
3. **Frontend** fetches from API, updates state
4. **UI** renders from state

### Why This Architecture is Good
- ✅ Single source of truth (database)
- ✅ RESTful API pattern
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ Easy to update (just re-seed database)
- ✅ No hardcoded data in frontend
- ✅ Reusable API (locations page, checkout, future features)

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Development

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Always verify `.env` file exists before deployment
   - Add `.env.example` to repository
   - Document required environment variables
   - Add startup check for critical env vars

2. **Database Seeding**
   - Verify seed data after deployment
   - Add count verification to seed scripts
   - Include seed status in health checks

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Include environment checks in test suite
   - Test with and without database connection
   - Verify external dependencies before UI tests

4. **Error Handling**
   - API should return meaningful errors when DB connection fails
   - Frontend should show user-friendly message when API fails
   - Add loading states and error states to UI
