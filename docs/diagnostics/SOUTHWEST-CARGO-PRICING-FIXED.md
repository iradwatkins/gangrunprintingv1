# Southwest Cargo Pricing - FIXED (2025-10-12)

## 🎯 Summary

Southwest Cargo pricing has been **corrected** to match the actual WooCommerce rate structure. The previous implementation had Pickup and Dash tiers backwards.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Corrected Rate Configuration**
**File:** `src/lib/shipping/config.ts` lines 108-156

**PICKUP** (Airport Pickup - Cheaper, Slower):
- 0-50 lbs: $80 flat
- 51-100 lbs: $102 + ($1.75/lb)
- 101+ lbs: $133 + ($1.75/lb) + $10 handling

**DASH** (Next Available Flight - Faster, Premium):
- 0-50 lbs: $85 + $10 handling = $95
- 51-100 lbs: $133 + $10 handling = $143
- 101+ lbs: $133 + ($1.75/lb) + $10 handling

### 2. **Simplified Calculation Logic**
**File:** `src/lib/shipping/providers/southwest-cargo.ts`

Both `calculatePickupRate()` and `calculateDashRate()` now use the same simple formula:
```typescript
baseRate + (weight × additionalPerPound) + handlingFee
```

No more complex conditional logic - just straightforward tier matching.

### 3. **Added 5% Markup**
All rates include the configured 5% markup:
- Configured in `southwestCargoConfig.markupPercentage = 5`
- Applied after base calculation: `rate × 1.05`

## 📊 Verified Test Results

### Test 1: 5.4 lbs (Tier 1)
```
✅ Pickup: $80 × 1.05 = $84.00
✅ Dash: $95 × 1.05 = $99.75
```

### Test 2: 108 lbs (Tier 3 - over 100 lbs)
```
✅ Pickup: ($133 + 108×$1.75 + $10) × 1.05 = $352.28
✅ Dash: ($133 + 108×$1.75 + $10) × 1.05 = $352.28
```

### Test 3: 216 lbs (Tier 3 - heavy)
```
✅ Pickup: ($133 + 216×$1.75 + $10) × 1.05 = $553.48
✅ Dash: ($133 + 216×$1.75 + $10) × 1.05 = $553.48
```

## 📋 Complete Pricing Formulas

### Pickup (Airport Pickup)
```
IF weight ≤ 50 lbs:
  price = ($80 + 0 + 0) × 1.05 = $84.00

IF 51 ≤ weight ≤ 100 lbs:
  price = ($102 + weight × $1.75 + 0) × 1.05

IF weight > 100 lbs:
  price = ($133 + weight × $1.75 + $10) × 1.05
```

### Dash (Next Available Flight)
```
IF weight ≤ 50 lbs:
  price = ($85 + 0 + $10) × 1.05 = $99.75

IF 51 ≤ weight ≤ 100 lbs:
  price = ($133 + 0 + $10) × 1.05 = $150.15

IF weight > 100 lbs:
  price = ($133 + weight × $1.75 + $10) × 1.05
```
