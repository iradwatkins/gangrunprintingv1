## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Good Prompts

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Be specific about what you want
- Include lighting details ("studio lighting", "natural light")
- Mention quality ("high quality", "4k", "professional")
- Describe composition ("on white background", "close-up")
- Use product photography terms

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Be vague ("a nice image")
- Include people (system automatically excludes)
- Exceed 480 tokens (~1440 characters)

### Prompt Formula

```
[Product Type] + [Setting/Background] + [Lighting] + [Quality/Style]

Examples:
‚úì "Red business cards on rustic wooden desk, natural window lighting,
   warm tones, professional photography"

‚úì "Stack of glossy brochures, white studio background, soft shadows,
   ultra sharp focus, 4k resolution"

‚úì "Flyers fanned out on marble surface, golden hour lighting,
   luxury product shot, high-end photography"
```

### Aspect Ratios (Default: 4:3)

- **1:1** - Square format
- **4:3** - Standard product (default)
- **16:9** - Wide format
- **3:4** - Portrait

_Note: Aspect ratio can be customized in future updates_

## Troubleshooting

### Image Generation Fails

**Error: "API key not configured"**

- Check `.env` file has `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY`
- Restart PM2: `pm2 restart gangrunprinting`

**Error: "Rate limit exceeded"**

- Wait 2-3 seconds between generations
- Google AI has rate limits to prevent abuse

**Error: "Prompt too long"**

- Keep prompts under 1440 characters (~480 tokens)
- Be concise but descriptive

### Drafts Not Loading

**"Product name required to view drafts"**

- Fill in Product Name field first
- Product name organizes drafts by product

**Empty drafts folder**

- Generate at least one image first
- Check MinIO is running: `docker ps | grep minio`

### Image Quality Issues

**Image looks low quality**

- System uses `2K` by default (ultra quality)
- Check if MinIO compressed the image
- Try regenerating with modified prompt

---

## Testing

**Quick Test (Terminal):**

```bash
cd /root/websites/gangrunprinting
source .env
GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY="${GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY}" \
  npx tsx scripts/test-ai-image-generation.ts
```

**Expected Output:**

```
