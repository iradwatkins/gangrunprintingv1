## Epic Title
Order Flow Optimization & Shipping Fix - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Fix the broken checkout page refactoring, properly integrate dynamic shipping rates, and ensure a seamless customer journey from product selection through order confirmation.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:
- **Current relevant functionality**: 
  - Checkout page was refactored but is now broken (component file only 30 lines)
  - ShippingRates component exists but isn't properly integrated
  - Shipping calculator API at `/api/shipping/calculate` with UPS, FedEx, Southwest Cargo providers
  - Checkout API hardcodes shipping at $10 standard/$25 express instead of using calculator
- **Technology stack**: Next.js 15.5.2, Square payments, Prisma ORM, shadcn/ui components
- **Integration points**: 
  - Cart context for item management
  - Square payment integration for checkout
  - Shipping calculator module with multiple providers
  - Order creation API at `/api/checkout`

### Enhancement Details:
- **What's being added/fixed**: 
  - Restore full checkout functionality from backup
  - Integrate dynamic shipping rates display
  - Add shipping method selection to order flow
  - Fix the broken refactored component structure
- **How it integrates**: 
  - Reconnect ShippingRates component in checkout flow
  - Update checkout API to use selected shipping rate
  - Ensure shipping costs flow through to Square payment
  - Maintain existing cart and payment functionality
- **Success criteria**: 
  - Checkout page fully functional with all steps visible
  - Shipping options display with real-time rates
  - Selected shipping rate properly charges customer
  - Complete order flow works end-to-end
  - Mobile-responsive checkout experience

## Stories

### Story 1: Restore and Fix Checkout Page Component
Restore the checkout page functionality from the BMAD backup, properly organize the refactored components, and ensure all UI elements render correctly. Fix the incomplete component.tsx file that's only 30 lines, reconnect all form sections (billing, shipping, payment), and verify cart items display properly.

### Story 2: Integrate Dynamic Shipping Rates Display
Connect the existing ShippingRates component into the checkout flow so customers see real shipping options. Update the component to properly receive cart items and address data, display loading states while calculating rates, and pass selected rate to the checkout submission.

### Story 3: Update Checkout API to Use Dynamic Shipping
Modify `/api/checkout/route.ts` to accept the selected shipping rate instead of hardcoding values. Update the order creation to store actual shipping carrier and method, ensure Square checkout includes correct shipping amount, and maintain backward compatibility for orders without shipping selection.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged - adding optional shipping parameters
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible - no changes needed
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - using shadcn/ui components
- [x] Performance impact is minimal - rates cached after calculation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing checkout flow for active customers
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Test thoroughly on staging environment first
  - Implement feature flag to toggle between old/new shipping
  - Keep hardcoded fallback rates if shipping calculator fails
  - Monitor checkout completion rates after deployment
- **Rollback Plan:** 
  - Revert to backup checkout page if critical issues
  - Shipping can fallback to hardcoded rates
  - All changes are UI/API level, no database migrations

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Checkout conversion rate maintained or improved
- [x] Shipping rates display accurately for all supported carriers

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation:
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural documentation is required
- [x] Enhancement follows existing patterns
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable

### Risk Assessment:
- [x] Risk to existing system is low
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points

### Completeness Check:
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [x] Stories are properly scoped
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Dependencies are identified

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Files to Modify:
- `/src/app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx` - Restore from backup and fix
- `/src/app/(customer)/checkout/page-refactored/component.tsx` - Complete the refactoring
- `/src/components/checkout/shipping-rates.tsx` - Ensure proper integration
- `/src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` - Accept dynamic shipping rates
- `/src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - Store shipping method details

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test with various cart configurations
- [ ] Verify shipping rates for different addresses
- [ ] Confirm Square payment includes correct shipping
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify order confirmation emails show shipping details
- [ ] Test fallback when shipping calculator unavailable

## Handoff to Story Manager

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This fixes a critical broken checkout flow in a production system
- Integration points: 
  - Broken checkout page needs restoration from backup
  - ShippingRates component exists but isn't connected
  - Shipping calculator API is functional at `/api/shipping/calculate`
  - Square payment integration for final checkout
- Existing patterns to follow: 
  - shadcn/ui components for all UI elements
  - React hooks for state management
  - Server actions for API calls
  - Existing cart context for item management
- Critical compatibility requirements: 
  - Must not break existing orders in progress
  - Fallback to hardcoded rates if calculator fails
  - Maintain Square payment integration
  - Preserve all existing checkout fields
- Each story must include verification that checkout still completes successfully

The epic should restore full checkout functionality while adding proper dynamic shipping rate selection, ensuring customers see accurate shipping costs before payment."
