### ✅ Test 3: Sample Data Generation

**Status:** PASSED
**Date:** October 15, 2025 08:43 CDT

**Test Script:** `test-analytics-dashboard.js`

**Actions Performed:**
- Created 1 test user
- Generated 50 test orders with realistic workflows
- Created status history for each order (1-5 status changes per order)
- Distributed orders across last 60 days

**Workflow Patterns Tested:**
1. **Fast orders**: PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMATION → PRODUCTION → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
2. **Bottlenecked orders**: PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMATION → PRODUCTION (stuck) → PRODUCTION → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
3. **Pickup orders**: PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMATION → PRODUCTION → READY_FOR_PICKUP → PICKED_UP
4. **Incomplete orders**: PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMATION → PRODUCTION (still in progress)
5. **Early stage**: PENDING_PAYMENT → CONFIRMATION (awaiting production)

**Results:**
- ✅ 50 orders created successfully
- ✅ 150+ status history entries created
- ✅ Orders distributed over 60 day period
- ✅ Realistic time intervals (1-10 days per status)
- ✅ Multiple workflow patterns represented

- **Solution:** Update DATABASE_URL in production environment and rebuild/restart app

**Required Steps:**
1. Ensure correct DATABASE_URL in `.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://gangrun_user:GangRun2024Secure@localhost:5434/gangrun_db?schema=public
   ```
2. Regenerate Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```
3. Restart application (Docker Compose or PM2)
4. Verify health endpoint returns `"status": "healthy"`

   - Verifies bottleneck detection

### For Production Optimization (Optional)

1. **Performance:**
   - Add Redis caching for analytics data
   - Implement query result caching (5-15 min TTL)
   - Consider materialized views for complex calculations

2. **Features:**
   - Export analytics to CSV/Excel
   - Email reports (weekly bottleneck summary)
   - Alerts when status avg time exceeds threshold
   - Comparative analytics (this week vs last week)

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Track analytics page views
   - Monitor API response times
   - Log bottleneck trends over time
