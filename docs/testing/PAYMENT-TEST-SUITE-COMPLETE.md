## 🚀 How to Execute Tests

### Quick Start - Playwright Tests

```bash
# 1. Update playwright.config.ts to point to production
# Change baseURL to: 'https://gangrunprinting.com'
# Set webServer: undefined

# 2. Run Square Card tests (3 iterations)
npx playwright test tests/payment-square-card.spec.ts --project=chromium --headed

# 3. Run Cash App Pay tests (3 iterations)
npx playwright test tests/payment-cashapp.spec.ts --project=chromium --headed

# 4. Generate test report
node generate-payment-test-report.js

# 5. View report
cat test-results/payment-test-report.md

# 6. Cleanup test data
npx tsx cleanup-test-orders.ts --force
```

### Alternative - Chrome DevTools MCP Tests

Ask Claude to execute using MCP tools:

```
"Claude, run test-square-card-chrome-devtools.js using your MCP chrome-devtools tools"
```

## 🔍 Database Verification

### Check Test Orders

```bash
# SSH to production server
ssh root@72.60.28.175

# Access database
docker exec -it gangrunprinting-postgres psql -U postgres -d gangrun_production

# Query test orders
SELECT
  "orderNumber",
  email,
  status,
  "paymentMethod",
  "squarePaymentId",
  total / 100.0 as total_dollars,
  "createdAt"
FROM "Order"
WHERE email LIKE '%test@gangrunprinting.com%'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Expected Output (After Tests Run)

```
 orderNumber  |              email               |    status     | paymentMethod | squarePaymentId | total_dollars |      createdAt
