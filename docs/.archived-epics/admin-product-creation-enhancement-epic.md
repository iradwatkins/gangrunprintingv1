# Admin Product Creation & Checkout Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement Epic

## Epic Title
Admin Product Creation & Checkout Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Fix critical bugs and enhance the admin product creation system from 90% functional to 100% reliable, ensuring image uploads work consistently, add-on options display properly, shipping provider selection works at checkout, and all product data flows correctly to customer-facing pages.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:
- **Current relevant functionality**:
  - Product creation form at `/admin/products/new` is mostly working
  - Image upload to MinIO with multiple size variants
  - Add-on sets, paper stocks, quantities, and sizes configuration
  - Product display on customer pages at `/products/[slug]`
  - Price calculation API at `/api/products/test-price`
  - Checkout page at `/checkout` with cart items and order processing
- **Technology stack**: Next.js 15.5.2, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, MinIO storage, Sharp image processing
- **Integration points**:
  - MinIO for image storage with CDN URLs
  - Product API at `/api/products` for CRUD operations
  - Customer product pages consuming product data
  - Price engine for dynamic pricing calculations
  - Checkout API for order processing and shipping calculations

### Enhancement Details:
- **What's being fixed/added**:
  - Fix broken code in products API route (line 127 syntax error)
  - Add preview of add-on sets contents when selecting
  - Improve image upload with preview before saving
  - Fix data transformation inconsistencies (camelCase/PascalCase)
  - Add live price preview during product configuration
  - Enhance error messages with field-specific details
  - Implement shipping provider selection (FedEx and Southwest Cargo/DASH) at checkout
  - Add real-time shipping rate calculation for selected provider
- **How it integrates**:
  - Maintains existing database schema
  - Enhances existing UI components without breaking changes
  - Improves API responses while maintaining backward compatibility
  - Adds visual feedback without changing core workflows
  - Integrates shipping selection into existing checkout flow
- **Success criteria**:
  - Zero errors in browser console during product creation
  - Image uploads succeed 100% of the time (within size limits)
  - Add-on selections show what's included before saving
  - Product data displays correctly on customer pages
  - Clear error messages guide users to fix issues
  - Live price updates as options are selected
  - Customers can select between FedEx and Southwest Cargo/DASH at checkout
  - Shipping rates update based on provider selection

## Stories

### Story 1: Fix Critical Bugs and Data Consistency
Repair the syntax error in `/api/products/route.ts` line 127, standardize API response format to use consistent property naming (PascalCase for frontend compatibility), and ensure MAX_FILE_SIZE constant is properly defined before use in error messages. Add proper error boundaries around image URL handling to prevent display breaks.

### Story 2: Enhance Add-On Selection Interface
Modify the ProductAdditionalOptions component to show a preview of what's included in each add-on set when hovering or selecting. Display individual add-ons with their prices, allow admins to see the impact on final pricing, and ensure selected add-ons properly display on customer product pages.

### Story 3: Improve Image Upload Experience
Add image preview before upload in ProductImageUpload component, show upload progress percentage, display all image variants after successful upload (thumbnail, medium, large), and implement retry mechanism for failed uploads. Ensure image URLs are properly formatted and accessible from customer pages.

### Story 4: Implement Shipping Provider Selection at Checkout
Add shipping provider selection interface to checkout page allowing customers to choose between FedEx and Southwest Cargo/DASH shipping. Implement radio button selection with provider logos, display estimated delivery times for each provider, calculate and show real-time shipping rates based on order weight and destination, and integrate selected shipping method into order submission. Ensure shipping cost updates the order total dynamically.

## Compatibility Requirements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Critical Fixes Required:

1. **API Route Bug** (`/api/products/route.ts`):
```typescript
// Line 127 - BROKEN:
:`, error)

// FIX TO:
console.error(`[${requestId}] Database error:`, error)
```

2. **Image Upload Constants** (`/api/products/upload-image/route.ts`):
```typescript
// Move MAX_FILE_SIZE definition to top of function
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB
```

3. **Data Transformation Standardization**:
- Use PascalCase consistently for frontend
- Remove duplicate properties in API responses
- Ensure customer pages receive expected format

### UI Enhancements:

1. **Add-On Preview Component**:
```typescript
// Show add-on details on hover/selection
<HoverCard>
  <HoverCardTrigger>{addOnSet.name}</HoverCardTrigger>
  <HoverCardContent>
    {addOnSet.items.map(item => (
      <div key={item.id}>
        {item.name}: +${item.price}
      </div>
    ))}
  </HoverCardContent>
</HoverCard>
```

2. **Live Price Preview**:
- Integrate price calculation into form state
- Update price display on any option change
- Show price breakdown (base + add-ons + quantity)

3. **Image Upload Improvements**:
- Show image preview before upload
- Display upload progress bar
- Show all generated variants after upload
- Add retry button for failures

4. **Shipping Provider Selection**:
```typescript
// Shipping provider selection component
<RadioGroup value={shippingProvider} onValueChange={setShippingProvider}>
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
    <RadioGroupItem value="fedex" id="fedex" />
    <Label htmlFor="fedex" className="flex items-center">
      <img src="/fedex-logo.svg" alt="FedEx" className="h-8 mr-2" />
      FedEx - ${fedexRate} (3-5 business days)
    </Label>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
    <RadioGroupItem value="southwest-dash" id="southwest-dash" />
    <Label htmlFor="southwest-dash" className="flex items-center">
      <img src="/southwest-logo.svg" alt="Southwest Cargo" className="h-8 mr-2" />
      Southwest Cargo/DASH - ${southwestRate} (1-2 business days)
    </Label>
  </div>
</RadioGroup>
```

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This enhances an existing product creation system that's 90% functional and adds shipping provider selection to checkout
- Integration points:
  - MinIO storage for images (already working, needs polish)
  - Products API with a critical syntax error at line 127
  - Add-on sets that need preview functionality
  - Customer product pages expecting specific data format
  - Checkout page requiring shipping provider integration
  - Shipping rate calculation APIs for FedEx and Southwest Cargo/DASH
- Existing patterns to follow:
  - shadcn/ui components for all UI elements (including RadioGroup for shipping selection)
  - Prisma ORM for database operations
  - Sharp for image processing
  - Zod schemas for validation
  - Existing checkout flow structure
- Critical compatibility requirements:
  - No breaking changes to existing products
  - API responses must support old and new formats
  - Image URLs must remain accessible
  - Price calculations must remain accurate
  - Shipping selection must integrate seamlessly with existing checkout
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality still works

The epic should deliver a rock-solid product creation experience where admins can confidently create products with proper image handling, clear add-on selection, and immediate visual feedback on their choices. Additionally, customers should have a smooth checkout experience with clear shipping options between FedEx and Southwest Cargo/DASH. All bugs should be eliminated and the system should feel polished and professional."
