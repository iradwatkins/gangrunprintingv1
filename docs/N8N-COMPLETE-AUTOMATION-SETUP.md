## üöÄ Next Steps - YOU MUST DO THIS

### 1. Activate All Workflows in N8N

1. **Open N8N Dashboard:**

   ```
   https://n8n.agistaffers.com/workflows
   ```

2. **For EACH workflow (all 11):**
   - Click on the workflow name
   - Toggle the "Active" switch to ON (top right)
   - Verify the workflow shows "Active" status

3. **Webhook URLs (for workflows 7, 8, 10):**
   - Workflow #7: `https://n8n.agistaffers.com/webhook/gangrun-order-created`
   - Workflow #8: `https://n8n.agistaffers.com/webhook/gangrun-order-delivered`
   - Workflow #10: `https://n8n.agistaffers.com/webhook/vps-downtime-alert`

### 2. Delete Old Conflicting Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**There's a conflict!** You have an old workflow that must be deleted:

- **Workflow to Delete:** "GangRun Printing - Order Notifications" (Telegram-based)
- **Reason:** Uses same webhook path as new workflows #7 and #8
- **How to Delete:**
  1. Go to https://n8n.agistaffers.com/workflows
  2. Find "GangRun Printing - Order Notifications"
  3. Click the 3-dot menu ‚Üí Delete
  4. Confirm deletion

### 3. Test Each Workflow

**Cron-based Workflows (1-6, 9, 11):**

- Click "Execute Workflow" button in N8N
- Check appvillagellc@gmail.com for test emails

**Webhook Workflows (7, 8):**

- Create a test order on GangRun Printing
- Mark it as PAID (triggers workflow #7)
- Mark it as DELIVERED (triggers workflow #8)
- Check appvillagellc@gmail.com

**Downtime Alert (10):**

- Will trigger automatically when service-monitor detects 502/504 errors
- Test manually: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/vps-downtime-alert -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"service":"test","url":"https://test.com","httpCode":"502","error":"Test","message":"Testing downtime alert"}'`

---

## üìû Troubleshooting

### Problem: Workflows not sending emails

**Check:**

1. Is workflow active in N8N? (toggle should be green)
2. Check N8N execution history for errors
3. Verify Resend API key is set in `.env`:
   ```bash
   grep RESEND_API_KEY /root/websites/gangrunprinting/.env
   ```

### Problem: Downtime alerts not triggering

**Check:**

1. Is workflow #10 active in N8N?
2. Check service monitor is running:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/service-monitor.log
   ```
3. Test webhook manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/vps-downtime-alert \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"service":"test","httpCode":"502"}'
   ```

### Problem: Marketing emails not sending

**Check:**

1. Are webhooks in database configured?
   ```bash
   docker exec -i gangrunprinting-postgres psql -U postgres -d gangrun_production -c "SELECT * FROM \"N8NWebhook\";"
   ```
2. Check order processing triggers webhooks:
   ```bash
   docker logs --tail=100 gangrunprinting_app | grep webhook
   ```
