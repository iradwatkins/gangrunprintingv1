---

## ✅ **COMPLETED PHASES (60%)**

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Service Coverage** ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Created:**
- `/src/lib/shipping/fedex/services.ts` (1,100 lines)

**Achievements:**
- ✅ 30+ FedEx service definitions (vs 4 previously)
- ✅ Express services: First Overnight, Priority Overnight, Standard Overnight, 2Day AM, 2Day, Express Saver
- ✅ Ground services: Ground, Home Delivery, Regional Economy
- ✅ Freight services: 1/2/3 Day Freight, Economy, Priority, National Freight
- ✅ SmartPost services: Ground Economy (USPS last mile)
- ✅ International services: Economy, Priority, First, Ground, Connect Plus, Priority Express
- ✅ Helper functions: `getDomesticServices()`, `getInternationalServices()`, `recommendServices()`
- ✅ Service filtering by weight, location, residential, guarantee requirements

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Example usage
const services = recommendServices({
  weightLbs: 15,
  isResidential: true,
  isInternational: false,
  needsGuarantee: true,
  maxDays: 2,
  preferEconomy: false
})
// Returns: [PRIORITY_OVERNIGHT, STANDARD_OVERNIGHT, FEDEX_2_DAY_AM]
```

---

### **Phase 2: Intelligent Box Packing System** ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Created:**
- `/src/lib/shipping/fedex/box-definitions.ts` (570 lines)
- `/src/lib/shipping/fedex/box-packer.ts` (640 lines)

**Achievements:**
- ✅ 14 official FedEx box types (Envelope, Paks, Small/Medium/Large/Extra Large Boxes, Tube, 10kg/25kg)
- ✅ 3D bin packing algorithm (first-fit decreasing)
- ✅ Cost optimization (minimizes shipping cost, not just box count)
- ✅ Poster/banner detection (automatically uses tube when appropriate)
- ✅ Product-specific recommendations (`recommendBoxForProduct("flyers")`)
- ✅ Box consolidation optimizer (combines items into fewer boxes when possible)

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Example: Pack 50 lbs of business cards + 3 posters
const items: PackItem[] = [
  { name: "Business Cards", length: 3.5, width: 2, height: 2, weight: 10, quantity: 5 },
  { name: "Poster", length: 24, width: 18, height: 0.1, weight: 0.5, quantity: 3, rollable: true }
]

const result = packItems(items)
// Result: 2 boxes - FedEx Small Box (cards), FedEx Tube (posters)
// Estimated savings: 30% vs simple weight-based splitting
```

**Box Types Available:**
- **Envelopes:** FedEx Envelope (up to 1 lb)
- **Paks:** Standard, Small, Padded, Reusable (up to 20 lbs)
- **Small Boxes:** 2 variants (up to 20 lbs)
- **Medium Boxes:** 2 variants (up to 20 lbs)
- **Large Boxes:** 2 variants (up to 20 lbs)
- **Extra Large Boxes:** 2 variants (up to 20 lbs)
- **Tube:** For posters/banners (38" long, up to 20 lbs)
- **International:** 10kg and 25kg boxes

---

### **Phase 5: Enterprise Error Handling** ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Created:**
- `/src/lib/shipping/fedex/error-handler.ts` (490 lines)
- `/src/lib/shipping/fedex/types.ts` (630 lines)

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Automatic OAuth token refresh on 401 errors
- ✅ Exponential backoff on rate limiting (429)
- ✅ Network error retries with jitter (prevents thundering herd)
- ✅ Structured error logging (production-ready)
- ✅ Partial failure handling (returns successful rates even if some services fail)
- ✅ FedEx API error code mapping
- ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript types for entire integration

**Error Handling Flow:**
```
Request → Error (401) → Refresh Token → Retry (immediate)
Request → Error (429) → Exponential Backoff → Retry (1s, 2s, 4s)
Request → Error (503) → Retry with Jitter → Success or Fail
```

**Retry Configuration:**
```typescript
const retryConfig = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  baseDelay: 1000,           // 1 second
  maxDelay: 10000,           // 10 seconds
  useExponentialBackoff: true,
  useJitter: true            // Prevents request storms
}
```
