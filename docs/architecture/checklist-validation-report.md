## 3. Risk Assessment

### Top 5 Risks by Severity

1. **HIGH - Incomplete Marketing Platform**
   - **Risk**: Phase 1 MVP requirement not met
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize Epic 6 implementation following shard-006-marketing.md
   - **Timeline Impact**: 2-3 weeks development required

2. **HIGH - Limited Admin Functionality**
   - **Risk**: Cannot manage orders and customers effectively
   - **Mitigation**: Complete Epic 5 following shard-005-admin.md
   - **Timeline Impact**: 1-2 weeks development required

3. **MEDIUM - Insufficient Test Coverage**
   - **Risk**: Bugs in production, regression issues
   - **Mitigation**: Implement Jest/Playwright testing suite
   - **Timeline Impact**: Ongoing, 1 week initial setup

4. **MEDIUM - Basic Monitoring Only**
   - **Risk**: Difficult to diagnose production issues
   - **Mitigation**: Integrate proper APM solution (consider Sentry)
   - **Timeline Impact**: 2-3 days implementation

5. **LOW - No Multi-language Support**
   - **Risk**: Limited market reach
   - **Mitigation**: Implement i18n following shard-007-localization.md
