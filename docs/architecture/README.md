## üéØ Architecture Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Simplicity First:** Choose simpler solutions that solve 80% of needs
2. **Type Safety:** TypeScript everywhere for compile-time safety
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with server-rendered, enhance with client features
4. **Modular Design:** Independent, pluggable modules (products, checkout, admin)
5. **Performance:** Optimize for initial page load and interactivity
6. **Security:** Authentication required for sensitive operations
7. **Testability:** Write testable code with clear separation of concerns

### Technology Decisions
- **Next.js 15:** Unified fullstack framework with App Router
- **PostgreSQL:** ACID compliance, JSON flexibility
- **Prisma:** Type-safe ORM with migrations
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first, rapid development
- **shadcn/ui:** Own your components, Radix UI base
- **Zustand:** Simple, performant state management
