## 🚀 How to Verify It's Working

### Method 1: Check Your Sentry Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to:** https://sentry.io
2. **Login** with your account (gangrunprinting-production email)
3. **Select project:** javascript-nextjs
4. **Check Issues tab:** You should start seeing events as users browse your site

### Method 2: Trigger a Test Error

Visit your site and do any action - Sentry will automatically capture:

- JavaScript errors
- Console warnings and errors
- Performance metrics
- User interactions

### Method 3: Wait for Real Errors

Sentry is now monitoring your site 24/7. When errors occur, you'll get:

- Email alerts (configured in Sentry dashboard)
- Full error details with stack traces
- User context (who experienced the error)
- Breadcrumbs (what they did before the error)

---

## 📊 What Sentry is Now Tracking

### ✅ Automatic Error Capture

- All unhandled JavaScript errors
- React component errors
- API route errors
- Database errors
- Payment processing errors

### ✅ Performance Monitoring

- API response times (10% sample rate)
- Page load times
- Transaction traces
- Slow database queries

### ✅ Structured Logging

- Console.log messages
- Console.warn messages
- Console.error messages
- Custom application logs

### ✅ User Context

- User ID when logged in
- Email address
- User role (CUSTOMER, ADMIN, etc.)
- Session information

### ✅ Request Context

- URL where error occurred

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Configure Alerts (Recommended)

Go to your Sentry project → Settings → Alerts:

**Critical Errors Alert:**

- Trigger: New issue appears
- Action: Email immediately
- For: All errors

**High Volume Alert:**

- Trigger: > 50 errors in 1 hour
- Action: Email + Slack (if you use Slack)
- For: Any route

### 2. Set Up Integrations (Optional)

Connect Sentry to:

- **Slack:** Get alerts in Slack channel
- **GitHub:** Link errors to code
- **Jira:** Create tickets from errors

### 3. Configure Source Maps (For Better Stack Traces)

Already configured! Your stack traces will show original TypeScript code, not compiled JavaScript.

### 4. Review Performance Tab

Check Sentry → Performance to see:

- Slowest API endpoints
- Slowest pages
- Transaction traces

---

## 📈 What You'll See
