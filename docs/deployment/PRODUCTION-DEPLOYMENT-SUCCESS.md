## 🔒 Data Architecture Confirmed

**NO hardcoded data anywhere:**

- ✅ Frontend fetches from `/api/airports` dynamically
- ✅ API queries PostgreSQL database via Prisma
- ✅ Database is single source of truth
- ✅ Airports will NOT disappear after deployments

**Data Flow:**

```
PostgreSQL Database (82 airports stored)
    ↓ Prisma ORM query
/api/airports endpoint (returns JSON)
    ↓ fetch() call in useEffect
Frontend Components (display dynamically)
```

## 🔄 How to Update Airports in Future

If Southwest Cargo adds/removes airports or changes details:

### Method 1: Re-run Seed Script

```bash
ssh root@72.60.28.175
cd /root/websites/gangrunprinting
npx tsx src/scripts/seed-southwest-airports.ts
```

The seed script uses `upsert()` so it's safe to run multiple times:

- Updates existing airports with new data
- Adds new airports
- Doesn't create duplicates

### Method 2: Update Individual Airport

Edit `src/scripts/seed-southwest-airports.ts` and modify the specific airport object, then re-run.

### Method 3: Admin Interface (Future)

Could build an admin panel to manage airports via UI instead of seed scripts.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If airports disappear after deployment:

1. **Check database is running:**

   ```bash
   docker ps | grep postgres
   ```

2. **Verify DATABASE_URL is set:**

   ```bash
   cat .env | grep DATABASE_URL
   ```

3. **Re-run seed script:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/seed-southwest-airports.ts
   ```

### If API returns 0 airports:

1. Check database connection
2. Verify Prisma can connect
3. Check for database migration issues
4. Re-run seed script

### If frontend shows "Loading..." forever:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint works: `curl http://localhost:3020/api/airports`
3. Check React useEffect is executing
4. Verify no CORS issues
