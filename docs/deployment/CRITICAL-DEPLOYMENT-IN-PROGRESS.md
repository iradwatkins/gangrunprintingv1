# CRITICAL: Deployment In Progress - Product CRUD Fixes

**Status:** REBUILDING DOCKER IMAGE NOW
**Time:** October 16, 2025 02:08 UTC

## The Problem

You are experiencing:

1. ‚ùå Cannot create new products (stuck at 12 products)
2. ‚ùå Cannot delete products
3. ‚ùå Cannot edit products
4. ‚ùå Cannot duplicate products
5. ‚ùå Image uploads failing

## Root Cause

**The container is running OLD CODE from 1.5 hours ago (20:35)**

All my fixes to add `credentials: 'include'` are NOT deployed yet because I never rebuilt the Docker image after making the changes!

## The Fixes (Already in Source Code)

### 1. Product CRUD Operations - FIXED IN SOURCE

**File:** `/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`

- Line 96: DELETE with `credentials: 'include'` ‚úÖ
- Line 34: PATCH toggleActive with `credentials: 'include'` ‚úÖ
- Line 54: PATCH toggleFeatured with `credentials: 'include'` ‚úÖ
- Line 72: POST duplicate with `credentials: 'include'` ‚úÖ

### 2. Image Upload - FIXED IN SOURCE

**File:** `/src/app/api/products/upload-image/route.ts`

- Line 149: Fixed `product.ProductCategory.name` (was productCategory) ‚úÖ
- Line 150: Fixed `product.ProductImage.length` (was productImages) ‚úÖ

### 3. Product Listing - ALREADY WORKING

**File:** `/src/app/api/products/route.ts`

- GET endpoint using correct PascalCase relation names ‚úÖ
- Currently returning 12 products correctly ‚úÖ

## What's Happening Now

1. ‚è≥ Building NEW Docker image with ALL fixes
2. ‚è≥ Build started: 02:08 UTC
3. ‚è≥ ETA: ~2-3 minutes
4. üîÑ Will automatically restart container when build completes

## What Will Work After Deployment

‚úÖ Create products
‚úÖ Delete products
‚úÖ Edit products (toggle active/featured)
‚úÖ Duplicate products
‚úÖ Upload product images
‚úÖ Save products with images

## Current Product Count

**Database:** 12 products
**API:** 12 products (correct)
**Frontend:** Shows 12 products (correct)

The listing is working correctly. The CRUD operations (create/delete/edit) are failing because cookies aren't being sent.

## Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, test in this order:

1. **Create Product** - Try creating a new product
2. **Upload Image** - Try uploading an image to the product
3. **Toggle Active** - Click Active badge to toggle status
4. **Delete Product** - Delete a test product
5. **Duplicate Product** - Duplicate a product
