## üéØ Template Formula

```
professional product photography of {product} centered in frame,
commercial print shop production floor setting in background,
paper cutting equipment and printed sheets visible but softly blurred,

ambient workshop lighting in background, shallow depth of field,
4k resolution, just-completed-off-the-floor aesthetic,
commercial printing environment
```

### Key Elements:

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Why This Works

**Customer Psychology:**

1. **Authenticity** - Real manufacturing environment builds trust
2. **Quality Signal** - Professional equipment = professional results
3. **Craftsmanship** - Shows attention to detail in production
4. **Transparency** - "Nothing to hide" manufacturing process
5. **Made Fresh** - "Just completed" creates urgency

**Visual Balance:**

- Product **centered** = Clear focus
- Background **blurred** = Context without distraction
- Lighting **professional** = Premium quality signal
- Equipment **visible** = Credibility and authenticity

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Prompt Too Generic

**Problem:** AI generates stock photo look
**Solution:** Add "commercial print shop production floor" emphasis

### Equipment Not Visible

**Problem:** Background too blurred or absent
**Solution:** Add "equipment visible in background"

### Product Off-Center

**Problem:** Product positioned to side
**Solution:** Emphasize "centered in frame" at start

### Too Busy Background

**Problem:** Equipment distracts from product
**Solution:** Add "softly blurred" and "shallow depth of field"
