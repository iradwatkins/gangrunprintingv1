### 3. Integration Complete

**Checkout Integration:**
- ‚úÖ Added to `/src/app/api/checkout/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ Triggers `triggerOrderPlaced()` after order creation
- ‚úÖ Only for logged-in users (guest orders skip workflow)
- ‚úÖ Separated from n8n trigger (commented clearly)

**Event Integration Service:**

- ‚úÖ Functions for all event triggers:
  - `triggerUserRegistered()`
  - `triggerOrderPlaced()`
  - `triggerCartAbandoned()`
  - `triggerInactiveCustomer()`
  - `triggerEmailOpened()`

**Cron Job Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ Created `/src/scripts/workflow-cron-jobs.ts`
- ‚úÖ Functions:
  - `checkAbandonedCarts()` - Run hourly
  - `checkInactiveCustomers()` - Run daily
- ‚úÖ Setup documentation in `cron-setup.md`

---

### 4. Management Scripts Created

**Initialize Workflows:**
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/initialize-workflows.ts
```
Creates the 3 predefined workflows in database

**Activate All Workflows:**
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/activate-all-workflows.ts
```
Activates ALL workflows to start sending emails

**Cron Jobs:**
```bash
# Test abandoned cart check
npx tsx src/scripts/workflow-cron-jobs.ts abandoned-carts

# Test inactive customer check
npx tsx src/scripts/workflow-cron-jobs.ts inactive-customers

# Run all
npx tsx src/scripts/workflow-cron-jobs.ts
```

---

## üìã Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Initialize Workflows (2 minutes)
```bash
cd /root/websites/gangrunprinting
npx tsx src/scripts/initialize-workflows.ts
```

**This will:**
- Create Welcome Series workflow
- Create Abandoned Cart workflow
- Create Win-Back Campaign workflow
- Show you a summary of all workflows

### Step 2: Activate Workflows (30 seconds)
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/activate-all-workflows.ts
```

**WARNING:** This starts sending automated emails immediately!

### Step 3: Set Up Cron Jobs (5 minutes)
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add these lines:
# Abandoned Cart Check - Every hour
0 * * * * cd /root/websites/gangrunprinting && npx tsx src/scripts/workflow-cron-jobs.ts abandoned-carts >> /var/log/workflow-crons.log 2>&1

# Inactive Customer Check - Daily at midnight
0 0 * * * cd /root/websites/gangrunprinting && npx tsx src/scripts/workflow-cron-jobs.ts inactive-customers >> /var/log/workflow-crons.log 2>&1
```

### Step 4: Test Workflows (10 minutes)

**Test 1: Welcome Email**
1. Create a new user account
2. Check email for welcome message
3. Wait 3 days (or modify workflow for testing) for onboarding email

**Test 2: Order Placed**
1. Place an order as logged-in user
2. Workflow should trigger automatically
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM "WorkflowExecution" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 5`

**Test 3: Abandoned Cart**
1. Run manually: `npx tsx src/scripts/workflow-cron-jobs.ts abandoned-carts`
2. Check for users with cart items but no recent orders
3. Workflow should trigger for eligible users

## üéØ Architecture Summary

### Email Flow Separation

**n8n (Minimal Use - Backend Only):**
- ‚úÖ Vendor order notifications (print shop partners)
- ‚úÖ Daily admin reports

**FunnelKit (Primary System - Customer Facing):**
- ‚úÖ All customer emails (transactional, marketing, proactive)
- ‚úÖ Workflow automation
- ‚úÖ Customer journey tracking
- ‚úÖ Analytics (when funnel tracking implemented)

### Workflow Execution Model

```
User Event ‚Üí WorkflowEngine.handleEvent()
            ‚Üì
   Find active workflows with matching trigger
            ‚Üì
   Create WorkflowExecution record
            ‚Üì
   Execute steps sequentially:
   - Email (via Resend)
   - SMS (via Twilio - if configured)
   - Wait (schedule continuation)
   - Condition (branching logic)
   - Webhook (external integrations)
   - Tag (user segmentation)
   - Update User (profile changes)
            ‚Üì
   Mark execution as COMPLETED or FAILED
```

## üìä Database Tables Used

**Marketing Workflows:**
- `MarketingWorkflow` - Workflow definitions
- `WorkflowExecution` - Execution tracking
- `CustomerSegment` - User segmentation (optional)

**Campaigns:**
- `Campaign` - Email campaign records
- `CampaignSend` - Individual send tracking
- `SMSCampaign` - SMS campaign records (if using SMS)
- `SMSSend` - SMS send tracking

---

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

**Check Workflow Executions:**
```sql
SELECT
  we.id,
  we.status,
  we.currentStep,
  we.createdAt,
  we.completedAt,
  mw.name as workflow_name
FROM "WorkflowExecution" we
JOIN "MarketingWorkflow" mw ON we."workflowId" = mw.id
ORDER BY we."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Check Active Workflows:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, "isActive", trigger
FROM "MarketingWorkflow"
WHERE "isActive" = true;
```

**Check Campaign Sends:**
```sql
SELECT
  cs."recipientEmail",
  cs.status,
  cs."sentAt",
  c.name as campaign_name,
  c.subject
FROM "CampaignSend" cs
JOIN "Campaign" c ON cs."campaignId" = c.id
ORDER BY cs."sentAt" DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**View Cron Job Logs:**
```bash
tail -f /var/log/workflow-crons.log
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Email Opt-In Requirement:**
   - Workflow engine checks `user.marketingOptIn` before sending marketing emails
   - Transactional emails (order confirmations) always sent
   - Marketing emails (abandoned cart, win-back) only sent if opted-in

2. **SMS Opt-In Requirement:**
   - SMS workflows check `user.smsOptIn` and `user.phoneNumber`
   - Skips step if user not opted-in or no phone number

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Workflow execution failures are logged but don't crash the system
   - Failed executions marked as FAILED in database
   - Check `WorkflowExecution.errorMessage` for details

4. **Performance:**
   - Workflow execution is asynchronous (doesn't block order creation)
   - Uses `setTimeout` for wait steps (replace with job queue for production scale)
   - Consider Bull or Agenda for high-volume deployments
