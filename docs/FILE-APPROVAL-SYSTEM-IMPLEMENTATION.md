## 📋 Summary

Successfully translated 3 WordPress/WooCommerce plugins into a Next.js/TypeScript file management and approval system for GangRun Printing.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Design ✅
**Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**New Models Created:**
- `OrderFile` - Main file records with approval workflow
- `FileMessage` - Comments/messages on files

**New Enums:**
- `OrderFileType` - CUSTOMER_ARTWORK, ADMIN_PROOF, PRODUCTION_FILE, REFERENCE, ATTACHMENT
- `ApprovalStatus` - WAITING, APPROVED, REJECTED, NOT_REQUIRED
- `UploadedBy` - CUSTOMER, ADMIN, VENDOR, SYSTEM

**Key Features:**
- Tracks file metadata (size, type, thumbnail)
- Approval workflow (waiting → approved/rejected)
- Messages/comments system
- Visibility controls (customer vs admin)
- Notification flags
- Links to orders and order items

### 2. Database Migration ✅
- Schema pushed to PostgreSQL successfully
- Prisma client generated
- All relations and indexes created

### 3. API Routes Implemented ✅

#### `/api/orders/[id]/files` (route.ts)
- **GET** - List all files for an order
  - Filters by user permissions (admin sees all, customers see own)
  - Includes last 5 messages per file

## 🔄 Workflow Implementation

### Customer Upload Flow
1. Customer places order
2. Customer uploads design files via `/api/orders/{id}/files`
3. Files marked as `CUSTOMER_ARTWORK` with `NOT_REQUIRED` approval
4. Admin notified via `notifyAdmin` flag

### Proof Approval Flow
1. Admin uploads proof via same endpoint
2. File marked as `ADMIN_PROOF` with `WAITING` approval
3. Customer notified via `notifyCustomer` flag
4. Customer reviews and calls `/api/orders/{id}/files/{fileId}/approve`
5. Status changes to `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`
6. If rejected, customer adds message with changes
7. Admin uploads revised proof, cycle repeats
8. When all proofs approved, order marked ready for production

### Message Thread Flow
1. Either party uploads file with message
2. Ongoing conversation via `/api/orders/{id}/files/{fileId}/messages`
3. Admin can add internal notes (customer doesn't see)
4. Attachments supported on messages

## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions

### Why This Approach?
1. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript with Zod validation
2. **Scalability** - Separate file records from order items
3. **Flexibility** - Supports multiple file types and workflows
4. **Security** - Permission checks at every level
5. **Auditability** - Complete message/approval history

### Database Design Rationale:
- **OrderFile vs File** - New system is more feature-rich, kept old File for compatibility
- **FileMessage** - Separate table allows unlimited comments per file
- **Enums** - Type-safe status tracking
- **Relations** - Cascading deletes ensure data integrity

## 🔍 Testing the API

### Example: Upload Customer Artwork
```bash
curl -X POST https://gangrunprinting.com/api/orders/{orderId}/files \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=..." \
  -d '{
    "filename": "my-design.pdf",
    "fileUrl": "https://minio.gangrunprinting.com/files/abc123.pdf",
    "fileSize": 1024000,
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "fileType": "CUSTOMER_ARTWORK",
    "message": "Here is my final design!"
  }'
```

### Example: Approve Proof
```bash
curl -X POST https://gangrunprinting.com/api/orders/{orderId}/files/{fileId}/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=..." \
  -d '{
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "message": "Looks perfect, please proceed!"
  }'
```
