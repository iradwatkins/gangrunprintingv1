   - Cookie name: `landing_page_source`
   - Value: cityLandingPageId

2. **User adds product to cart** → Cookie preserved

3. **User completes checkout** → Cookie read
   - Saved to `Order.sourceLandingPageId`

4. **Payment successful** → Metrics updated
   - Status changes to `CONFIRMATION`
   - Landing page metrics increment:
     - `orders` +1
     - `revenue` + order total
     - `conversionRate` recalculated

   - Mentions specific neighborhoods
   - References local landmarks
   - Includes population statistics
   - Discusses local economy

2. **City-Specific FAQs** (5 questions)
   - "How fast can you deliver to [neighborhood]?"
   - "Do you serve [business district]?"
   - "What's the best [product] for [local event]?"

3. **Dynamic Schema Markup** (7 types)
   - Organization
   - LocalBusiness (with city coordinates)

   - BreadcrumbList
   - WebPage
   - HowTo

4. **Local Context**

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before launching your first campaign:

- [ ] Create test landing page set (1-2 cities)
- [ ] Verify pages load correctly

- [ ] Verify cookie attribution works
- [ ] Place test order and check metrics update
- [ ] Review AI-generated content quality
- [ ] Check schema markup in Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Test different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Pages Not Showing
- **Check status:** Must be "published" in admin dashboard
- **Check URL:** Format is `/print/[slug]/[city-state]`
- **Check database:** Query `CityLandingPage` table

### Metrics Not Updating
- **Check cookie:** Browser dev tools → Application → Cookies
- **Check order status:** Metrics only update on `CONFIRMATION` status
- **Check landing page ID:** Must match cookie value

### AI Generation Fails
- **Check API key:** Ensure `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY` is set
- **Check rate limits:** Google Gemini has usage limits
- **Check logs:** PM2 logs show detailed errors

### SEO Not Working
- **Wait 2-4 weeks:** Google needs time to crawl and index
- **Submit to Search Console:** Manual submission speeds up indexing
- **Check robots.txt:** Ensure not blocking Googlebot
- **Verify schema:** Use Google Rich Results Test
