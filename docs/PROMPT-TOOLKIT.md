## üìù **Notes**

- Camera specs (Canon EOS R5, 8K, HDR) do NOT create visible watermarks
- AI interprets "city culture" intelligently (added Michael Jordan statue for Chicago!)
- "gangrunprinting" branding always stays subtle
- 1:1 aspect ratio works perfectly for product page grids
- Rustic wooden table creates warm, high-conversion sales atmosphere
- **CRITICAL:** For 4x6 flyers, always specify "4 inches wide by 6 inches tall with clear edges visible" and "rectangular" to show correct proportions within 1:1 square frame. Otherwise AI makes the flyer square!
