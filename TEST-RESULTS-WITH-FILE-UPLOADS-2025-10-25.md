## File Storage Architecture

### MinIO Configuration
- **Bucket:** `gangrun-uploads`
- **Access Key:** gangrun_minio_access
- **Endpoint (Internal):** http://localhost:9002
- **Endpoint (Public):** https://gangrunprinting.com/minio
- **Storage Path Pattern:** `orders/{orderId}/{filename}`

### File Upload Flow
1. **Order Created** → Order and OrderItem records inserted
2. **File Read** → Test image read from host filesystem
3. **Upload to MinIO** → File uploaded to S3-compatible storage
4. **OrderFile Record** → Database record links file to order
5. **File URL** → Public URL generated for file access

### Example File URLs
```

## Technical Implementation

### Order Creation Script
**File:** `/root/websites/gangrunprinting/create-test-orders-with-files.js`

**Key Features:**
- Creates test customer if doesn't exist
- Generates unique order numbers (TEST-XXXXXXXXXX-XXXX format)
- Calculates pricing accurately
- Creates Order and OrderItem records
- **Uploads files to MinIO**
- **Creates OrderFile tracking records**
- Associates with test customer
- Stores shipping/billing addresses as JSON
- Includes complete order configuration

### Technologies Used
- **Prisma ORM** - Database operations
- **AWS SDK S3 Client** - MinIO file uploads
- **MinIO** - S3-compatible object storage
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database
- **Docker** - Container orchestration

---

## MinIO Configuration Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Wrong Endpoint
**Problem:** Using `https://gangrunprinting.com:9002` (with HTTPS and port)
**Solution:** Use `http://localhost:9002` (HTTP, host-based script)

### Issue 2: Wrong Credentials
**Problem:** Using default `minioadmin` credentials
**Solution:** Load from `.env` file:
- Access Key: `gangrun_minio_access`
- Secret Key: `gangrun_minio_secret_2024`

### Issue 3: Wrong Bucket Name
**Problem:** Using generic `gangrun-printing` bucket
**Solution:** Use correct bucket from `.env`: `gangrun-uploads`
