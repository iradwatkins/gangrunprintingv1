## 📁 Two Upload Pages Architecture

### 1. Standalone Upload Page (Primary)

**Path:** `/src/app/(customer)/upload-artwork/page.tsx`
**URL:** `http://gangrunprinting.com/upload-artwork`
**Purpose:** Upload files BEFORE viewing cart
**Flow:** Product → Upload → Cart
**Features:**

- Works without cart items (independent)
- Simple, focused interface
- Stores files in sessionStorage

### 2. Cart-Embedded Upload Page (Fallback)

**Path:** `/src/app/(customer)/cart/upload-artwork/page.tsx`
**URL:** `http://gangrunprinting.com/cart/upload-artwork`
**Purpose:** Upload files AFTER cart (if customer skips first upload)
**Flow:** Product → Cart → Upload (if needed) → Checkout
**Features:**

- Requires cart items to exist
- Multi-item upload support
- Progress tracking
