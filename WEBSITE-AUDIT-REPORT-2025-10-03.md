Screenshot: sarah.johnson.test-04-configured-1759496225854.png
```

#### Technical Details:
**Product Information:**
- Product ID: `4faaa022-05ac-4607-9e73-2da77aecc7ce`
- Product Slug: `test`
- Product Name: `adsfasd`
- Category: `Booklet`
- Status: Active

**Database Configuration (Verified ‚úì):**
- ‚úÖ Quantity Groups: 1 configured
- ‚úÖ Size Groups: 1 configured
- ‚úÖ Paper Stock Sets: 1 configured
- ‚úÖ Turnaround Time Sets: 1 configured

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The database has all required product configuration data, but the frontend is failing to:
1. Fetch the configuration data from the API
2. Render the configuration UI components
3. Enable the Add to Cart functionality

**Probable Causes:**
- Frontend API call failing silently
- React component error causing render failure
- Missing or incorrect API endpoint for product configuration
- Data transformation error between API and frontend
- JavaScript error in product configuration component

#### Recommendation:
**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** üö®

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors on product page
2. **Verify API endpoint** at `/api/products/[id]/configuration` is responding correctly
3. **Test product configuration component** with existing product data
4. **Add error boundaries** to show user-friendly error messages
5. **Implement fallback UI** if configuration fails to load

---

### üü° ISSUE #2: Single Product Available

**Severity:** P1 - High
**Impact:** Limited product selection for customers
**Status:** Product Catalog Incomplete

#### Details:
- Only **1 active product** in database
- Product appears to be a test/placeholder product
- Product name "adsfasd" and description "asdfas" are not customer-ready
- 35 product categories exist but only 1 product configured

#### Impact on Business:
- Cannot showcase full product catalog
- Limited revenue potential
- Poor customer experience
- Incomplete site functionality

#### Recommendation:
1. Create real products for each category
2. Use proper product names and descriptions
3. Add product images
4. Configure pricing for each product
5. Enable at least 10-15 core products before launch
